<span>COLONEL CROCKETT ON A BEAR-HUNT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"I say, stranger, did you see any thing of a confounded
big b'ar passing this way?"</p>

<p>The question was uttered by Davy Crockett, the renowned
bear-killer of Tennessee, as, dashing at full speed through the
dense forest, he suddenly emerged into a small clearing, where
a big Dutchman sat on a log eating his dinner. The latter
stared at the glowing hunter for a moment, and with his
mouth crammed so full that he could hardly speak, he said:</p>

<p>"Hooh! vat you said?"</p>

<p>"Did you see a b'ar pass this way, a few minutes ago?"</p>

<p>"Vat kind of a bear vas he?"</p>

<p>"A black bear and a regular whopper."</p>

<p>"Vas he goin' py hees legs, or vas he flyin' mit his wings?"</p>

<p>Crockett stared at the Dutchman, as if meditating whether
to bring him to his senses or not by breaking his gun
over his head; but there was such an appearance of honesty
in his countenance, that, despite his hurry, he paused to exchange
a word or two with him.</p>

<p>"Dutchy, did you ever see a bear?"</p>

<p>"Yaw, I vos."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see one fly through the air?"</p>

<p>"Yaw&mdash;more as goot many times."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"I see'd one only next day after yisterday. He had wings
so big as never vos, and had von sheep dat he hold fast
mit his toes."</p>

<p>Crockett laughed.</p>

<p>"You old Dutch blunderbuss, you mean an <i>eagle</i>."</p>

<p>"Yaw; vot kinds does I means?"</p>

<p>"A <i>bald-headed</i> eagle, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yaw&mdash;dat's him; ef he <i>bald</i>-headed, den he <i>bare</i>-headed,
ain't he?"</p>

<p>"I suppose."</p>

<p>"Den he eagle vot was <i>bare</i>&mdash;hooh? vot you call him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Den he <i>bear</i> mit wings."</p>

<p>And the Dutchman laughed, as though he had said something
extremely funny, while Crockett was amused in spite
of himself.</p>

<p>"Vos he great pig bear, mit four legs?" inquired the Hollander,
suddenly becoming serious again.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a ring-tailed roarer."</p>

<p>"And he hop along so?" he continued, dropping on his
hands and feet and hopping along like a frog.</p>

<p>"Something like that," assented Crockett.</p>

<p>"And his mouth open, mit his tongue hanging in?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes: which way did he go?"</p>

<p>"Yaw; I hash not seen notting of him!"</p>

<p>And again the Dutchman laughed until he was ready to
fall off the log, all the while cramming his mouth with food.</p>

<p>There was no little humor in Colonel Crockett, and the
round fat Dutchman, shaking with laughter, like so much
jelly, was more then he could stand, and throwing back his
head, he made the forest ring with his own mirth.</p>

<p>This made Hans Bungslager go it harder then ever, till
finally he capsized&mdash;and tipping over the log backward, the
last Crockett saw of him, as he moved away, was his dumpy
legs beating the air, as he sought to complete his partial
summerset so as to rise to the standing position again.</p>

<p>But Colonel Crockett was seeking the trail of the most
enormous bear he had seen since coming into Texas, and as he
had a special anxiety to secure and take it back to camp, he
was fearful of losing too much time.</p>

<p>So, without cultivating the acquaintance of Bungslager
any further, he turned his back upon him and struck into the
woods, making for a point where he believed there was a
good prospect of finding his prey.</p>

<p>I may say, to relieve all anxiety of the reader, that
Hans finally succeeded in turning over on his face, and
regaining his feet. He was very nearly choking, however,
from the food which had gone the "wrong way," and, when
he finally recovered his self-command, and looked around
for the American hunter, he had vanished like a phantom.</p>

<p>All this was some thirty odd years ago. The eccentric
Colonel Crockett, who had served several terms in Congress,
had been disappointed of a reëlection, and had left Tennessee
and gone off to the territory, or rather republic, of Texas, there
to join the Texans who were gallantly struggling for their independence
against Santa Anna, and the hordes of Mexicans
that were overrunning the country.</p>

<p>Crockett was a born hunter, and when he reached this part
of the world, he found there was an abundance of game&mdash;so
much that he was tempted to linger by the way, and delay his
visit to the Alamo, which was doomed to make such a wonderful
struggle against the overwhelming forces that were
marshaling against it.</p>

<p>He, with several friends, was therefore off on a several days'
hunt in the wilds of eastern Texas. He had joined a party
on their way to the Alamo, but while they halted at a small
village some miles back, he had gone on with several others to
take part in a grand hunt.</p>

<p>In that vast State, as is well known, are found buffaloes, deer,
pumas, ocelots, jaguars, wild-cats, black bears, wolves, foxes,
raccoons, opossums, rabbits, hares, squirrels, antelope, mountain
goats and moose; besides, prairie-hens, wild geese, wild turkeys,
brant, teal, canvas-back ducks, pheasants, quails, partridges,
grouse, woodcock, pigeons, turtle-doves, rice-birds, and numerous
others&mdash;to which may be added murderous Mexicans, and
equally murderous and more daring Comanches, Apaches and
other tribes, so that there was a good prospect of Crockett
and his friends securing all the sport that they could possibly
wish.</p>

<p>Starting off together, they had gone but a short distance
when they discovered a dozen buffaloes grazing on the slope
of a hill, about a quarter of a mile distant, and the whole
parted, dashed away in pursuit.</p>

<p>The buffaloes took the alarm, and while yet a good ways
off, thundered away at full speed, leading the hunters on quite
a long chase. They were in full tilt after them, when the
keen eye of Colonel Crockett detected an immense bear on
his right, making for the cover of a dense tract of forest.</p>

<p>Davy Crockett had a weakness for bears; he had slain his
hundreds in the wilds of Tennessee, and he preferred hunting
them to any species of game known. So the instant he
caught sight of this monster, he shouted:</p>

<p>"Go ahead after the buffaloes, and I'll chase the bear."</p>

<p>With which he turned his mustang to the right, and sped
away in pursuit of his favorite prey.</p>

<p>But bruin had a good start, and made such good time that
he plunged into the wood several hundred yards in advance
of Crockett, who strained every point to catch up with the
frightened brute.</p>

<p>It was of no avail, however, and hurrying in a short distance
among the trees, Crockett found the wood too dense to
continue the pursuit on horseback; and, determined not to
lose his sport in this way, he leaped to the ground, hastily
fastened his bridle to a limb, and continued the pursuit on
foot.</p>

<p>His skill enabled him to keep on the trail of the bear,
without trouble, until, while running at full speed, he dashed
into the clearing, where Hans Bungslager was eating his dinner
on the log. The particulars of their interview have been
given.</p>

<p>In his great haste, and in dodging in and out among the
trees and undergrowth, Crockett had gotten off the trail of the
bear, and was hunting for it when he ran against Hans Bungslager.
He knew that he could not be far from his game, and
that by running across the general direction he had been following
he was certain of intersecting it.</p>

<p>This he did, and, as he anticipated, met with success, almost
immediately. Such a large animal as a bear, and especially
this one, could not fail to leave a perceptible trail, which
the keen eyes of Crockett were quick to detect.</p>

<p>The hunter was deprived of one great advantage. When
hunting in the Tennessee canebrakes, he was always accompanied
by a number of dogs, that were sure to "tree" their
game very quickly and to afford the greatest assistance in the
hunt. But now he had not a single yelper with him, and was
compelled to rely on himself entirely.</p>

<p>Hark! He heard the crackling of twigs and brush ahead&mdash;evidence
that he was gaining rapidly upon his prey. He
bent to the pursuit with renewed ardor, and, although he could
not see the bear, he knew that he was close upon him.</p>

<p>On, on dashed the hunter, tearing through the underbrush,
with scarcely a halt to turn aside, until a wild scream of agony
made his blood tingle, and leaping into a small clearing the
next instant, he beheld a scene so exciting in its character that
it almost stopped the beating of his heart.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span>IN CLOSE QUARTERS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The bear seemed to know that a dangerous enemy was
upon his track, and was not only frightened but infuriated by
the fact. In his aimless flight, he came directly upon a small
clearing, in the center of which stood a log-cabin cottage, surrounded
by a small patch of cultivated ground.</p>

<p>At the very moment of his appearance, a lithe, handsome
young lady was passing across this clearing with a pail of water
in her hand. Catching sight of the bear, she uttered a shrill
scream of terror, that caught Crockett's ear, and ran at full
speed for the open door of her cabin, while the exasperated
brute, with a growl of fury, made for her.</p>

<p>The girl was fleet of foot, and seemed to run with the speed
of the wind; but the bear was so close upon her, that, when
she darted into the door she had not time to close it behind
her.</p>

<p>As Davy Crockett sprung into the clearing he caught a
glimpse of the girl as she vanished through the door, and saw
the huge brute lunging after her. As quick as thought his
rifle was at his shoulder, and he blazed away at his hind quarters,
so rapidly disappearing from view.</p>

<p>It would have been better if the shot had not been fired,
for, striking the monster in the haunch, it did not inflict even
a dangerous wound, and only succeeded in adding to the fury
of the animal, whose rage was already at the boiling-point.</p>

<p>The hunter saw him twitch from the stinging pain, as, with
an ominous, cavernous growl, he disappeared in the cabin,
from whose interior were heard the heart-rending shrieks of
the terror-stricken girl.</p>

<p>Crockett became desperate. His rifle was of no further
use, and throwing it aside, he threw his arm back of his
neck, and drew forth an awful-looking knife&mdash;a genuine
Bowie, presented to the hunter by the daring little inventor
himself.</p>

<p>"Panthers and wildcats!" he exclaimed, as he ran like a
deer across the clearing; "that bear has got into the wrong
pen, and ef he isn't got out in a hurry, he'll raise the biggest
kind of a rumpus, which I rather reckon he's doing now!"</p>

<p>In a twinkling, he was at the door, and without hesitation
sprung within. Only a glance was needed to understand the
situation.</p>

<p>The fair fugitive, upon reaching the interior of the cabin,
had felt instinctively that there was no safety upon the lower
floor, and had gone up the stairs in the corner, in a more expeditious
manner than she had ever done before.</p>

<p>The bear evidently had not seen her, and was nosing
around for her in the lower apartment. When the hunter
bounded into the room, he was the very man he wanted to
see and he "went for him."</p>

<p>Crockett had been in a hand-to-hand struggle before with
these creatures and he knew what they were. He wasn't particularly
anxious to be caught at a disadvantage, so when the
brute made a plunge at him, he dodged and slipped aside, the
bear striking with such force against the door that it was
banged to, and the two contestants were thus shut together.</p>

<p>"Come up-stairs! quick!" shouted the same voice that had
uttered the screams. "Come quick or you will be killed!
he will have you sure, if you don't hurry!"</p>

<p>Now, if this same voice had only remained quiet, it is not
at all improbable that Crockett might have retreated up-stairs;
but, with his characteristic stubbornness, he determined to
pay no heed to this appeal, while at the same time he was actuated
by a suspicion that perhaps the bear might invade this
retreat, and thus endanger the young lady whom he was so
anxious to befriend.</p>

<p>"Never mind me," he called out, as he dodged to the other
side of the room and kept his eyes fixed keenly upon his antagonist.
"I've been in this kind of business afore, but look
out the brute don't find out where you are, for I don't blame
him for wanting to swaller such a purty piece."</p>

<p>The girl didn't appeal to him any more: doubtless she concluded
she was only wasting her breath.</p>

<p>The lower floor, I should remark, was like the ordinary
apartments of the log-cabins on the frontier. One large room
occupied the lower part of the building, and here were the
fire-place, closet, table, chairs and various domestic articles.</p>

<p>Crockett glanced at the fire-place in the hope of finding
some embers there, but one look showed that the young lady
had made her preparations for kindling a fire, but the light
had not yet been applied; so that means of defense was
thereby rendered unavailable.</p>

<p>But he still grasped his huge Bowie, all-potent in his hands,
and he concluded it was time his formidable enemy was made
to feel its point.</p>

<p>The bear did not permit him to remain idle long, but turning
with wonderful quickness for such a lumbering animal,
he reared on his hind legs, and with his red mouth open and
growling voice, came in a direct line toward him.</p>

<p>Every thing was now to be sacrificed for defense, and catching
up the table, Crockett slammed it full in the face of the
bear, and then darting nimbly forward, plunged his knife
half-way to the hilt in his body. He would have driven it to
the handle, had not the point encountered a bone.</p>

<p>Having no time to repeat the blow, he withdrew the weapon,
and leaped backward, just in time to escape the furious lunge
of the brute. The blood poured in a stream from the frightful
wound made, but the bear seemed to feel no loss of
strength and to be unconscious of the hurt he had received.</p>

<p>A few more such blows, however, were only needed to
"settle the hash" of the creature, and Crockett now endeavored
to inflict them as speedily as possible, without receiving
any return.</p>

<p>The bear was awkward in his movements, but there was
also a certain swiftness that made it exceedingly dangerous to
his antagonist. At the same time, his size compelled more
dexterity upon the part of Crockett, who leaped and danced
about the room like an acrobat on exhibition.</p>

<p>Finding himself in a corner, the hunter was forced to dart
so close to the bear that its descending paw grazed his back
and tore off a few strips from his hunting-shirt, and a twinge
or two of pain, reminded him of what was in store for him, if
the brute once got him in his embrace.</p>

<p>Again the knife sunk deeply into the body of the bear,
being driven this time from the back, and sent in with such
vigor, that it produced a sensible effect upon the raging monster.</p>

<p>But such a mass of vitality was not easily destroyed, and
for the time the bear was more furious than ever. Crockett
was kept so continually dodging and leaping about, that he
found it utterly impossible to get in another blow; and as he
circled around the room, he was in imminent peril of being
thrown down by some of the articles of furniture that were
continually in his way.</p>

<p>Moving thus, too, he caught a glimpse of a pair of eyes, peering
down from the stairs, while the fair owner held a rifle in
her hands as if awaiting the opportunity to use it.</p>

<p>"Shall I shoot?" she finally asked, in a suppressed voice,
as he passed near her.</p>

<p>"When you're sartin of plugging him," replied Crockett,
never once removing his eyes from the glowing orbs of the
beast.</p>

<p>It was plain that if the hunter was going to escape with his
life, something must be done to weaken the bear, that was
pressing him so close that a collision could not be postponed
much longer.</p>

<p>Any man who has ever met Colonel Davy Crockett knows
that when fairly aroused he had a fearful temper, and was
reckless in what he did. His blood was now fairly up, and
he determined that he had retreated about long enough.</p>

<p>"Confound you!" he muttered, as he steadied himself
against the side of the wall, preparatory to making his charge,
"do you think I am afeard of you?"</p>

<p>And then uttering a yell, such as he had heard escape the
throats of the Creek Indians at the massacre of Fort Mimms,
he bounded toward his foe.</p>

<p>The bear at this minute was reared on his hind legs, with
paws up. Crockett, as he reached these formidable weapons,
ducked his head, so as to pass beneath them, and as quick as
thought buried his knife into the side of the brute.</p>

<p>It was a terrible blow, and gave the creature such a spasm
of pain that his paws dropped almost involuntarily, and Crockett
was compelled to extricate himself in such haste, that he
was unable to withdraw his knife and take it with him.</p>

<p>This made his situation ten-fold more perilous. He had
no weapon at all with which to defend himself, and it was
only left for him to await the fierce onslaught of the terrible
foe. Thoroughly aroused, he was determined on recovering
his knife, even though at the imminent risk of his life.</p>

<p>"Come up-stairs!" shouted the terrified girl, who was
vainly seeking a chance to fire upon the bear, "he will kill
you <i>now</i>, sure!"</p>

<p>"Let him kill me then!" was the stubborn reply of Crockett.
"I am going to git that knife ag'in, or he's going to git
me."</p>

<p>Believing he had a chance, the hunter made a lunge for it.
He struck the handle, but he could not retain his hold, and,
as his hand slipped off, he received a staggering blow from
the bear, that knocked him to the floor.</p>

<p>A gasp of terror escaped the girl, but Crockett recovered
himself and made another attempt to regain his property.</p>

<p>Again his hand grasped the handle, and the brute made for
him. Had the hunter let the knife go, and sprung out of the
way, he would have escaped easily; but, mad with rage, he
held fast to it, refusing to loosen his grip, even when he
felt the weight of the paws upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>With a desperate effort, he jerked the Bowie loose, the
blood gushing after it in a copious stream. Then he attempted
to pull away, but it was too late, and the two went
down together, locked in a death embrace, Crockett believing
that his last day had come!</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span>THE ALARM!</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Certain that the hunter was doomed to death, the fair
stranger, whose own escape had been so narrow, could restrain
herself no longer. With rifle in hand, she leaped
down the stairs, and made her way toward the combatants
upon the floor.</p>

<p>Colonel Crockett was in great extremity, for, in spite of
the terrible wounds the bear had received, he still possessed
tremendous strength, and now that he had got his foe in his
arms, he was bent on giving him the "death-hug," without
any unnecessary delay.</p>

<p>But the hunter now had the Bowie in his powerful right
hand; he used it with all the strength and skill at his command.
While his own face was in such proximity to the terrible
snout of the wood monster, he plunged his knife again
and again into his side, with a frequency and power certainly
sufficient to kill any animal but a Texan bear.</p>

<p>Still the fearful gripe of those immense fore legs, grew
more rigid each moment, until Crockett felt the breath of life
leaving his body, and was certain that the walls of his breast
were being caved in.</p>

<p>"Fire! quick!" he managed to gasp, as he saw the girl
with the gun standing near them.</p>

<p>"I am afraid of hitting you!"</p>

<p>"Never mind if you do&mdash;don't wait."</p>

<p>Placing the muzzle directly against the head of the monster,
the girl pulled the trigger of her rifle.</p>

<p>The most vital part of the bear was pierced. The ball
went crashing through his brain, and with a sort of sigh, his
great strength failed him; he rolled heavily over upon his
side, and breathed his last.</p>

<p>As quick as a flash, Colonel Crockett disengaged himself
and sprung to his feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are killed!" wailed the girl, as she sunk upon
the edge of one of the overturned chairs, "you can not live
with such frightful wounds!"</p>

<p>The hunter was indeed a distressing object to look upon.
The blood from the beast covered him almost from head to
foot, and, scattered over his face, it made him look as if he
had been lacerated by the claws of the brute.</p>

<p>"Me!" exclaimed the delighted Crockett, "I have not been
harmed a bit: I've only had a good squeezing, but, I'm gradually
getting my breath back again. Howsumever, I've been
hugged before, and I've no doubt such a good-looking gal as
you have been hugged, too. If I hadn't a blue-eyed little
wife, down in Tennessee, I'd be tempted to play the bear to
you."</p>

<p>"Oh! how can you jest at such a terrible time?" said the
girl, her face blanched with terror.</p>

<p>"I know I ought to be ashamed of myself," said Crockett,
as he looked down and realized what a plight he was in,
"but it was always a weakness of mine to be joking when I
hadn't oughter. If I ain't too impertinent, may I ax your
name?"</p>

<p>"Katrina Duncan."</p>

<p>"Where is your father and mother?"</p>

<p>"I have none."</p>

<p>"What! you don't live here all alone?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I live with my uncle and aunt."</p>

<p>"Where might they be just now?"</p>

<p>"My aunt has gone to the village."</p>

<p>"That is a dozen miles away."</p>

<p>"The creek runs near the house, and she used the canoe.
She can easily get back by nightfall."</p>

<p>"And your uncle&mdash;I haven't seen any thing of him."</p>

<p>"He is in the woods at work."</p>

<p>A sudden suspicion entered the head of Crockett.</p>

<p>"What is his name?"</p>

<p>"Bungslager."</p>

<p>"Ah! I see'd him in the woods&mdash;the jolliest Dutchman I
ever sot eyes on. When do you expect&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Doonder and blitzen!"</p>

<p>Turning their heads, the two saw the very man of whom
they were speaking, standing in the door. Short, fat, sturdy,
with his round, moon-like face lit up by a pair of round eyes
that were the embodiment of wonder and amazement.</p>

<p>"What dis mean, eh? Vot hash somepody peen doin',
eh?"</p>

<p>"You have visitors, uncle."</p>

<p>"Yaw, as I sees, but when my visitor brings von pig pear
mit him, I vish he leaf him inside de out doors."</p>

<p>"He didn't bring him, uncle; the bear came himself, and
this gentleman rushed in to prevent him from killing me."</p>

<p>"Oh, yaw, and got killed himself. I ish glad to see you,"
said Hans, advancing and offering his hand; "dis ish your
gun vat I picks up."</p>

<p>"It looks like the critter," said Colonel Crockett, advancing
and taking his weapon. "I see'd I couldn't make no use of
it, so I dropped it and sailed in with my Bowie, and ef it
hadn't been fur Katrina here, it would have been the last of
old Davy Crockett."</p>

<p>Hans Bungslager stopped and looked at the hunter with a
curious expression.</p>

<p>"What your name ish?"</p>

<p>"Colonel Davy Crockett."</p>

<p>"From Tennessee?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>The Dutchman burst into a laugh that nearly shook him to
pieces.</p>

<p>"You ish dat pig fool, eh, dat went to Congress and didn't
know noffin. I heerds 'pout you, and dinks you de piggest
fool as never vas."</p>

<p>This was not very complimentary to Crockett, but the good
nature of Hans Bungslager was irresistible, and he laughed to
see him laugh.</p>

<p>Katrina was somewhat embarrassed, and thought it her duty
to apologize for the rudeness of her uncle.</p>

<p>"He doesn't mean any thing," said she, turning toward the
hunter; "it's a way he has. He got some papers that told
about you in Congress, and he was so pleased that he staid
home two or three days, and did nothing but sit in his chair
and laugh."</p>

<p>"He's a lucky dog to be able to laugh so much," replied
Crockett, with a serious air. "I have done a good deal of
laughing in my time, but I reckon I've felt like crying as
many times. Howsumever, I s'pose you want to get this carcass
out the room."</p>

<p>Katrina replied that such was her wish, and Crockett and
his host laid hold and managed to drag the huge creature outside
the door. He was pulled some distance away, when the
hunter, taking his Bowie in his hand, ran his finger along the
edge.</p>

<p>"Go way with yer buffalo-steaks and venison, when I can
git b'ar meat," said he, as he began operating upon it. "I'm
going to stay to supper with you. I s'pose you've eat b'ar-steak?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yaw!" replied Hans; "I eats him once."</p>

<p>"How did you like him?"</p>

<p>"A Mexican&mdash;one greaser, gif him me to <i>p'ison</i> me; ef I had
eat but lettle I would died; but I eat so much dat I spit him
up ag'in."</p>

<p>"Get out! wait till I cook ye a hunk of it; you'll like it
better than any sourkrout you ever saw."</p>

<p>Bungslager shook himself with laughter at the thought of
his finding any thing in the way of food that could please his
palate better than that savory article; but he stood by and
watched Crockett, as he handled his knife with a skill that was
really admirable.</p>

<p>The bear was in prime condition, and, after laying his
shaggy hide back, the hunter cut out several slices that looked
quite tempting, and which he asserted would tickle the tongue
of any one, when properly cooked and placed upon the table.</p>

<p>The hide was carefully taken from the entire body, and
then the carcass was rolled into the creek to float away, as
being of no further use, while Crockett carefully washed the
stains from his own person. Then bearing the hide over his
arm, and the clean-looking meat, the two returned to the cabin.</p>

<p>During their absence, Katrina had improved the time to
the utmost. The furniture, except where irreparably injured,
had been placed to rights, the floor scrubbed up, and the fire
kindled, and every preparation made for preparing a meal.</p>

<p>Looking at the bright, cheerful room, one could scarcely believe
that a few minutes before it had been the scene of such
a frightful contest as I have described.</p>

<p>When Crockett explained his wishes, the really charming,
rosy-cheeked girl yielded her place to him at the fire, and he
commenced the preparation of his bear-steaks. The savory
odor soon filled the room, and placing some fresh butter and
snowy bread upon the table, the three sat down to their
meal.</p>

<p>But they were doomed to an interruption. The first mouthful
was not yet tasted, when through the open door the figure
of a young man was seen approaching, walking with a rapid
stride across the clearing.</p>

<p>As he came nearer, it was easy to see from his blanched
face and excited manner, that he was the bearer of some important
and alarming tidings.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<span>THE FLIGHT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The individual who was seen hastening across the clearing,
showed in his actions that he was an acquaintance of Bungslager
and his niece.</p>

<p>"Well, Sebastian, what is it?" asked the latter, while the
quick flush that overspread her face told Colonel Crockett at
once what relation existed between them. Even in that moment
of excitement the young man had time to cast one admiring
glance upon the maiden.</p>

<p>"I've bad news! the worst news!"</p>

<p>All turned away from the table and looked expectantly toward
him.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Three runners reached Brownston, a couple of hours ago,
with the news that a big war-party of Comanches are approaching!"</p>

<p>"Ish dat all?" exclaimed Hans, with a sigh. "I dinks my
cow has tumbled over a log, and hurts herself."</p>

<p>"But they will be there by to-night."</p>

<p>"Does my frow know it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; she besought me to hurry to you, and urge you to
come at once, without a moment's delay. As soon as I learned
it, I prepared to come, although several urged me against it,
as they thought I would be intercepted before I could get
back; but I have made all haste."</p>

<p>"From what p'int are they coming?" asked Crockett, who
had the sense to perceive that this was a serious peril that
threatened the Dutchman and his niece.</p>

<p>"From the north-east," replied Sebastian, turning toward
Crockett, who had risen to his feet.</p>

<p>"How do you know that they intend attacking the village?"</p>

<p>The young man looked at the hunter a moment without
replying.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are a stranger in these parts, for if you
wasn't, you would know that Brownston has been attacked
several times before, although never by such a large force as
now threatens it. A good many of our men are off in the
Texan war, and a good many more are going; but, we've had
so many of these raids by the Comanches, that we've got used
to them. We're better prepared than we used to be."</p>

<p>"Do you think the village is in danger itself?"</p>

<p>"No," was the prompt reply. "As we have been warned,
I do not see as there is any danger at all."</p>

<p>"Then if we can get <i>there</i>, we shall be safe?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly."</p>

<p>"It is about a dozen miles away," added Crockett, in a
voice which showed he was considerably relieved; "it ain't
likely that the red-skins will be there before night."</p>

<p>"No; we do not fear for Brownston itself, now that we
have been notified, but it is the outlying houses, that are in
such danger, and quite a number of the folks have gone out
to warn them."</p>

<p>"Then let's set down and make a meal on b'ar-steaks, and
all go to the village together," setting the example, by taking
his place at the table again.</p>

<p>The coolness with which this was uttered had a most reassuring
effect upon the others. Sebastian, (as the young
Texan was called,) was a volunteer in the war of independence
of the Lone Star State, and was home in his native village of
Brownston for a short time to see his friends, when this alarm
reached his ears.</p>

<p>Knowing full well the ferocious character of the Comanches,
and that in their wars, they made no discrimination between
Mexican, Texan or American, the tidings filled him
with the gravest alarm, concerning the beautiful Katrina and
her uncle.</p>

<p>He was glad to find a guest there whose appearance showed
him to be a man of knowledge, skill and daring, and who
could not fail to prove a most valuable auxiliary in escaping
the peril which had descended so suddenly upon them. He
advanced and offered his hand.</p>

<p>"I am Sebastian Carsfield, a Texan, fighting against Santa
Anna. I am glad to make your acquaintance."</p>

<p>"And I am on my way to the Alamo," replied Crockett,
warmly shaking his hand.</p>

<p>"Then we are brothers: I join you at the meal."</p>

<p>"I dinks you ain't so much hungry as I vas," said Hans,
who was quite impatient at the delay, and who attacked the
viands with renewed appetite. Katrina was so flustered by
the exciting news and the presence of her lover, that she became
quite thoughtful and ate very little.</p>

<p>Crockett seemed to have forgotten entirely that such a thing
as a hostile force was threatening them, and joked and jested
in his usual manner. He related many of his adventures in
Tennessee, in hunting bears, and some incidents of his eventful
career in Congress, and his memorable tour through the
northern States.</p>

<p>In this way the afternoon wore rapidly away, the dinner
was lengthened, and by the time that the party rose from the
table, the latter part of the day was half gone.</p>

<p>As the "frow" of Bungslager had gone to the village of
Brownston in the canoe, there was no means of making the
journey by water, so it was arranged that the dozen intervening
miles should be made overland. Hans owned a sturdy
horse, not very fleet, but tough and enduring, upon which he
proposed to load every thing necessary, while he and Katrina
walked.</p>

<p>Sebastian had come on foot, not pausing to procure a horse,
and Crockett offered to yield his mustang to her, as the animal
was at no great distance, and he intended to procure him before
setting out for the village.</p>

<p>But she declined. None of the party were more able to
walk than she, and in the labyrinths of the woods, she had
more confidence in her own limbs than in those of any quadruped
or biped.</p>

<p>It was agreed that Crockett should go after his mustang
and then follow a bridle-path that he could easily find, which
struck the creek about a mile below the cabin of Bungslager,
and there await the coming of his friends. At the same time
Sebastian was to descend the river some distance below, to see
whether any thing more could be discovered regarding the
Comanches, and then was to return to the point mentioned,
where it was believed that all would rendezvous at the end of
a couple of hours.</p>

<p>With this understanding the parties separated&mdash;Crockett
taking the trail made by the bear, while he was pursuing it,
as the speediest way of reaching the point where he had left
his mustang tied. Sebastian located the bridle-path with
such exactness that he was certain of finding it without any
delay.</p>

<p>The Texan, with his heavy rifle slung over his shoulder,
strode off in an eastern direction, following the course of the
creek. As he looked up to the sky, and saw how near the
sun was setting, a shade of anxiety crossed his face. He felt
that they had lingered too long in the cabin, after the danger
became known. It was now impossible to get fairly started
for Brownston, before night was closing in, and the probabilities
were that the place would not be reached before daylight.</p>

<p>These hours of darkness would be hours of the greatest
peril to his friends. He had no doubt that the vigilant, ferocious
Comanches would be between them and the village before
the night was half gone. Such a large party could
hardly hope to make their way through the lines without
discovery&mdash;especially with the blundering Hans Bungslager,
who seemed incapable of comprehending the grave character of
the danger that menaced them.</p>

<p>"I am afraid we shall see the worst kind of trouble, before
many hours come and go!" muttered the Texan, as he
strode thoughtfully through the forest.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span>A SLIP OF THE MEMORY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Colonel Crockett was also equally thoughtful. He felt
that a mistake had been made through his agency, and that
the gravest consequences might be the result.</p>

<p>"Them b'ars have always got me into trouble," he muttered,
impatiently. "I s'pose if I git into a fight with a
greaser and a b'ar comes along, I'll leave him and put for the
b'ar."</p>

<p>He had easily found the trail of the brute, and kept it
without trouble. The way back seemed much longer than
when he was pursuing the beast with so much zeal; but he
traveled very fast, and reached the open prairie before the
sun had set.</p>

<p>In one hand he carried his long, reliable rifle, and over
the other was hung the huge shaggy hide of the black bear.
Its size and character made it too valuable for him to leave
until it could become dried, and so he took it to make sure
of having so valuable an article.</p>

<p>Reaching the edge of the prairie, he found that his mustang
had managed to disengage his bridle and was cropping the
grass near at hand. Crockett was on the point of emerging
from the woods, when his quick eye detected something out
upon the plain.</p>

<p>Scarcely a half-mile distant, and almost precisely upon the
spot where he had left his companions to pursue their buffaloes,
he saw fully a hundred mounted Comanche Indians.</p>

<p>"By hokey-pokey!" muttered the hunter, as he stood and
watched the sight, "that means business, sure enough!"</p>

<p>The band of red-skins seemed to be holding a sort of council.
They were gathered in a large circle, the heads of their
horses pointed inward, while a dozen or two on foot stood in
the center, apparently debating together upon some proposed
scheme, while their devoted followers were waiting until their
leaders were ready to give their orders.</p>

<p>Colonel Crockett stood almost fascinated at the sight. The
Comanches were fine-looking men, gayly dressed in bright
colors, all mounted on magnificent horses, and, as is well
known, they are among the finest horsemen in the world.
Sitting as motionless as carved figures, they would have formed
a capital scene for a painter.</p>

<p>The question that naturally occurred to the hunter was
whether these made up the entire force of Comanches that
were marching against Brownston. If they did, the town
being forewarned, certainly had little to fear from them; but
the settlers who dwelt in the surrounding country were as
powerless to resist this band, as though all the red-skins west
of the Rio Grande should descend upon them.</p>

<p>Crockett felt that time was important, and that he endangered
the safety of others by waiting; but, he was so anxious
to watch their movements that he determined to wait awhile
at least, and try to discover their intentions.</p>

<p>His experience among the Creek Indians had given him a
good knowledge of Indian character and ways, and he was
not long in understanding that was a sort of council&mdash;those in
the center of the large circle, having all to say in the matter.</p>

<p>Crockett first carefully approached his own mustang, and
securing him, sprung upon his back, and then held himself in
readiness to flee in case the red-skins should turn their
faces toward him.</p>

<p>Some fifteen minutes passed in this painful suspense, when
a simultaneous shout arose from the group, and they were
seen turning their horses about, and brandishing their weapons
about their heads.</p>

<p>The conclusion had been reached!</p>

<p>The Comanches were now ready to march!</p>

<p>And just at this moment, Colonel Crockett became aware
that the faces of the Indians were turned toward him, and
their horses were galloping at full speed directly at the point
in the wood where he stood.</p>

<p>"Be sure you're right, then go ahead," growled Crockett,
as he wheeled his mustang about, "and I think it's right for
me to kick gravel."</p>

<p>The proximity of the trees was such that, as I have shown
before, the hunter dismounted and continued the pursuit on
foot; but now, under the influence of fear, his mustang seemed
to shoot in and out among the trees like a swallow in its
flight.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they see'd me," muttered Crockett, as he ducked
his head to avoid being swept off his horse or having his head
swept off his shoulders. "I don't think they did, or they
wouldn't have sent so many after me. Howsumever, maybe
they've heard that I am a member of Congress."</p>

<p>Unconsciously Crockett had turned the head of his horse
toward the path, for which he ought to have searched, and his
horse suddenly plunged into it, and wheeled off to the right,
and followed it at the same headlong speed.</p>

<p>This made traveling a great deal easier, and the mustang
plunged along at a really swift gait, his rider every now and
then casting his head around, in the expectation of catching a
glimpse of those fearless dogs yelping upon his track.</p>

<p>"If they can ride through this wood any faster than me,"
exclaimed Crockett, as a limb knocked his coon-skin cap from
his head, "then I'd like to stop and see them."</p>

<p>He kept up this break-neck pace for some time longer, and
hearing nothing of his enemies, he paused and listened. The
sound of a leaf that rustled through some branches overhead
and fluttered down upon his shoulder was all that reached his
ear, besides the hurried breathing of his animal.</p>

<p>"Sartinly if they war coming I'd hear them," he concluded,
after listening for a few minutes, and every thing was still as
the grave.</p>

<p>Dismounting from his mustang, he knelt down and placed
his ear upon the ground. Had there been horsemen anywhere
in the neighborhood, the tramp of their feet would have been
heard, but to his surprise Crockett heard nothing at all.</p>

<p>"There's one thing sartin," said he, "them Comanches ain't
on my trail, so I'll give the hoss a little rest."</p>

<p>With which he drew his animal down to a moderate walk.</p>

<p>By this time it was growing dark, and despite the speed
with which Crockett had ridden, he was yet a great deal behindhand,
on account of waiting to watch the movements of
the red-skins. He ought to have been at the rendezvous long
before this.</p>

<p>All through the tumultuous excitement Crockett had clung
to his bear-skin with almost the tenacity that he grasped his
rifle. He had done it almost unconsciously, even after his cap
was swept from his head.</p>

<p>He was on the point of starting ahead again when his quick
ear detected something suspicious. The sound was very slight,
but such as it was, it convinced him that there was some one
coming along the path.</p>

<p>Not knowing what it meant, the hunter drew his horse
aside out of the path, and then waited and watched. The
obscurity was so great that he could not see very distinctly,
but in the gloom he discovered two men, who passed by on a
rapid run. He could see that they were Indians, and that
they were moving very fast.</p>

<p>What struck Crockett as singular was that these red-skins
were pursuing the opposite direction from him. Either they
must have passed by the rendezvous toward which he was
hurrying, or they had gone dangerously near it.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" the Tennessean asked himself, beginning
to feel a little puzzled at the action of the red-skins;
"these are queer critters&mdash;these Comanches&mdash;they don't
do business like the Creeks and Choctaws. Now how did
them two rapscallions get round on t'other side of me? They
couldn't have passed me in the path, for I was riding too
blamed fast."</p>

<p>He returned to the path again, and, as his horse walked
along, he thought seriously upon the situation of himself and
friends.</p>

<p>Suddenly he started.</p>

<p>Could it be that there was another band of Comanches on
the other side of Hans Bungslager's cabin? Or were these
scouts who were scouring through the country in search of
victims, and having discovered the flight of the fugitives, had
they made all haste to the main body that the whites might
be cut off before there was a chance of escape?</p>

<p>The more he reflected upon what he had seen, the more
serious alarm did he feel. It was not for himself that he
feared, but it looked to him as though the gentle Katrina
Duncan was in greater danger than she or her friends
imagined.</p>

<p>He continued riding forward, his horse on a moderate walk,
until in the moonlight he caught the glimmer of water ahead,
and he knew that he was drawing near the rendezvous.</p>

<p>Feeling it his duty to be suspicious on all occasions, he
dismounted again, and fastening his horse beside the path,
crept stealthily forward and looked about him. The creek was
broad and deep, but he saw no person or boat visible.</p>

<p>Where was Sebastian? was the question he asked himself,
as he looked furtively about. "Can it be that those two
Comanches have slain him, and his dead body is somewhere
at hand?"</p>

<p>He stood irresolute a moment, debating whether to begin
the search or not, when a low, cautiously-uttered whistle
reached his ear. Suspecting that it was a signal from some
Indian to another, he stepped further back in the shadow, and
cocked his rifle, determined to shoot the first red-skin that
showed himself.</p>

<p>The whistle was repeated, and finally Crockett ventured to
answer it. He had scarcely done so when a figure appeared in
the path before him whom he at once recognized as Sebastian,
the Texan.</p>

<p>The two met and clasped hands in the moonlight like old
friends.</p>

<p>"Where are they?" was the first whispered question of
Crockett.</p>

<p>"I do not know; I have seen and heard nothing of them
since I left there this afternoon."</p>

<p>"How long have you been here?"</p>

<p>"Over an hour. What kept you?"</p>

<p>The hunter gave a concise account of what I have already
made known to my readers, and then asked him his experience.</p>

<p>"I reached here as quick as I could, after leaving you,"
replied the young Texan, "but the boat I expected to find
here was gone, so I went down the creek about a mile, where
I found it caught in some bushes."</p>

<p>"How did it get there?"</p>

<p>"It must have got loose and drifted down there; I remember
the prow only rested against the bank, and it might have
done it very easily."</p>

<p>"Have you seen any of the Comanches?"</p>

<p>"Not one," replied Sebastian.</p>

<p>"That's blamed queer," muttered Crockett; "there's a
strange look about things that don't suit. What can keep
Bungslager?"</p>

<p>"He may be in trouble&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hello! there he comes!" interrupted Crockett, as he saw
the pursy form of the Dutchman emerge from the wood,
leading his horse that was heavily loaded with his domestic
utensils and food.</p>

<p>The two men stood until he advanced to where they were,
and then with a blanched face Sebastian asked the question:</p>

<p>"<i>Where is Katrina?</i>"</p>

<p>Hans Bungslager turned about and looked at the back of
his horse a moment, as if in a maze of perplexity, and then
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Doonder and blitzen! I Forgot her!</span>"</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span>ALL WRONG.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>"Forgot her!" exclaimed the astounded Sebastian; "how
did you do that?"</p>

<p>"I dinks at first she drops off de hoss&mdash;but afore I starts
she goes back to look fur de cow, and I forgits about her till
I gots here, and den I dinks, 'cause you ax me."</p>

<p>"This is a serious business," said the young Texan, turning
toward Crockett. "I think Bungslager is a little the biggest
fool I ever saw. It won't do to go on to the village and
leave the girl alone in the woods."</p>

<p>"I rather guess not&mdash;'specially when she's such a purty
piece of calikar as that. I'd be very glad to go back arter
her, but, as she'd be a blamed sight gladder to see you, and
you'd be gladder yet to see her, why I ain't the man to interfere."</p>

<p>The Texan coughed, and pretended not to comprehend the
meaning of Crockett hastily replying:</p>

<p>"Suppose, then, you and Hans go on toward the village
while I go back after her."</p>

<p>"I'm agreeable."</p>

<p>"The path follows the creek all the way, and Hans has
traveled it often enough to know it, so you won't be delayed
on that account. Good-by and good-luck to you!"</p>

<p>"'Bass," called out Hans, as he saw the young man start
off.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" was the quick, business-like response.</p>

<p>"You goes arter Katrina, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I do not propose to desert her."</p>

<p>"Ef she hain't found te cow, you can help her looks for
him, and den you drives her into de village, and we has protein
and milk for supper."</p>

<p>"We'll see to that," replied Carsfield, who had no wish to
dispute with the Dutchman, "but, of course, I will look after
Katrina first."</p>

<p>"Yaw; te cow has got a bell on her neck, so dat it will be
easy fur to find her and den&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused as the young man had vanished in the wood,
and turning back to Crockett asked:</p>

<p>"Do we waits here till dey don't come, or do we don't go
on till arter dey don't come?"</p>

<p>"I think so," replied Crockett, not exactly certain whether
his answer was any more luminous than the question itself.</p>

<p>"Yaw; dat ish all right&mdash;I allers dink so."</p>

<p>"Sebastian advises us to keep on toward the village; we
won't be able to travel very fast, as your horse has got about
ten wagon-loads on his back, and if you're going to ride on
top, he'll have to set down and rest about every hundred
yards. So they will overhaul us, afore we can reach the village.
Are you going to ride your hoss? If not you're welcome
to straddle mine."</p>

<p>"No; I rides my hoss&mdash;you see he expects me, and I dush
not disapp'ints him."</p>

<p>"All very well," replied Crockett, "but how the hokey-pokey
are you going to get on top?"</p>

<p>"I shows you."</p>

<p>Hans Bungslager, as I have said, had his horse so loaded
down that he was almost invisible. The pillow-bed "lapped"
on each side so much that his head and a little of his neck
could be seen. On this was placed another bulging tick,
while numerous articles were adjusted and balanced with a
skill which showed that the delicate hand of Katrina had
borne a share in the task. These necessarily projected from
the side of the horse, but she had remembered that the path
they expected to follow was quite narrow, and the "breadth"
was principally upward.</p>

<p>Having walked to this point, Hans concluded that he was
entitled to ride, and indeed in loading his horse, care had
been taken to arrange the articles so as to make him a nice
comfortable seat.</p>

<p>Hans displayed his innate sagacity by leading the horse beside
a short stunted tree with a projecting stumpy limb, upon
which, with considerable "boosting" by Crockett, he managed
to climb, and then, thanks to the gentleness of his horse, he
safely "located himself upon his back."</p>

<p>"Now I ish ready," he called out, hitching about a little,
so as to make sure he was firmly seated; "drive ahead."</p>

<p>Crockett pressed forward, and in the gloom saw a well-defined
path before him, running parallel with the creek.
This was the one referred to by Sebastian, and he took it at
once.</p>

<p>Hans Bungslager succeeded in riding his horse better than
would have been expected. By keeping in the center of the
path, the trees and shrubbery at the sides did not interfere
with his movements. The only difficulty was that by being
elevated so much, he got his face pretty well scratched and
occasionally was compelled to duck and dodge rather vigorously.</p>

<p>Crockett's native humor now and then manifested itself,
when he turned about and saw the ludicrous figure in the
rear; but, at the same time, he could not help feeling that
they were threatened by a danger so serious that it ought to
demand their entire thought.</p>

<p>The sky was clear, and the bright moonlight here and
there penetrated through the tree-tops, lighting up the path
and occasionally giving birth to frightful grotesque figures,
that to a man's excited imagination would be apt to assume
the form of reality.</p>

<p>But Colonel Crockett had been through too many trying
scenes to be frightened by shadows. He dreaded not them&mdash;but
he did dread the Comanches, that certainly could be at no
great distance, and through whose lines it would be very difficult
to pass in order to reach the village.</p>

<p>Had his own convictions been acted upon, the whites would
not have attempted to make the settlement at all. In the
dense woods which surrounded the cabin, there were any number
of places where they could have concealed themselves, and
waited until the danger had passed; but others had the right
to decide upon their course of action, and his generous nature
would not permit him to forsake them so long as they were
in peril.</p>

<p>The two horses walked silently through the wood, the only
sound being the faint clamp of their feet, and the rustling of
the shrubbery against the baggage of Hans Bungslager. Occasionally
he spoke to Crockett, but not often, as the Dutchman,
reckless as he was, could not fail to see that it was no
time for conversation.</p>

<p>So they progressed for a mile or so, when Crockett suddenly
heard a furious gasping.</p>

<p>"Whoa! doonder and blitzen! whoa."</p>

<p>Checking his own horse and turning his head, he could see
that Hans was in trouble. His obedient animal had instantly
stopped upon being appealed to, but he was still in difficulty.</p>

<p>"What is it?" inquired the colonel.</p>

<p>"Doonder! dish limb has cotch my nose under de shin, and
I can't gets my neck loose. Back!" he commanded to his
horse, that, moving back a step or two, enabled him to free
himself from the snare into which he had run his head.</p>

<p>"Can I help you any?" asked the hunter, who was not
certain whether he was still in trouble or not.</p>

<p>"Yaw; you can help me as never vas."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Crockett, springing from his mustang, and
hurrying back beside him.</p>

<p>"You goes pack to de capin, and up-stairs in my room,
under te bed, yer finds some bear-grease; if you rubs dat on
my chin here I feels goot."</p>

<p>"I'll see you hanged first," growled the hunter, as he hurried
back to his horse. "If you ain't the greatest Dutchman
in Texas, or the United States, then I'll go back to Tennessee
and run for Congress ag'in."</p>

<p>Had there been no one beside himself and the Hollander
concerned, Crockett would not have attempted to keep him
company; but the beautiful Katrina, and the gallant young
Texan had already won a warm place in the heart of the
grizzled adventurer, and he was willing to incur any personal
risk for them. As it was, he saw that, under Providence, all
depended upon his watchfulness, and he therefore determined
to assume the part of master, so long as he was compelled to
keep company with Hans.</p>

<p>Nothing of Indians yet.</p>

<p>Crockett had scarcely thought this, when he heard the reports
of three guns in rapid succession, but a short distance to
the right of them in the wood, and not a little startled, he
reined up and listened, Hans from necessity being compelled
to do the same.</p>

<p>They waited five or ten minutes, when, hearing nothing
more, the journey was resumed, Colonel Crockett feeling a
conviction that some sort of trouble was at hand.</p>

<p>A hundred yards or so further on the horse of the hunter
stopped, and leaning forward, the rider saw that the path
divided, a branch turning off quite sharply to the right, while
the other kept almost directly ahead.</p>

<p>Being an utter stranger, of course he appealed to Hans.</p>

<p>"Which do we take, the right or left?"</p>

<p>"De right," was the instant reply.</p>

<p>"You're sartin of that?"</p>

<p>"Yaw."</p>

<p>"Then we will go ahead."</p>

<p>And the famous Tennessean acted upon the motto, which
has been quoted so many times, both during and after his life,
his animal walking forward in quite a lively, business-like
fashion.</p>

<p>Crockett began to think that it was time the young Texan
and his lady-love put in an appearance. He felt a longing for
the society of such a daring, chivalrous young man, as he
knew Carsfield to be, and he thought that at the tardy rate pursued
by him and Hans, the two fleet-limbed lovers ought to be
somewhere in the vicinity.</p>

<p>But fully another mile was now passed and nothing was
heard of them. Once again the report of a gun had been
heard, but this time it was in another direction, and so
far away, as to be quite a relief. Neither of the alarms had
come from the rear, so there was no reason to fear that Carsfield
and Katrina were in any difficulty.</p>

<p>"I say, hilloa!" suddenly called out Hans, in the husky,
eager tones of one who is alarmed and excited. "I say,
hilloa!"</p>

<p>"Wal, what's the matter, man?" inquired the hunter, reining
up his mustang until the horse of the Dutchman could
approach no closer.</p>

<p>"I hash sumfin' to dells you."</p>

<p>"Let me hear it then."</p>

<p>"It ish a good joke."</p>

<p>And thereupon Hans began shaking with laughter, until it
really seemed as if he would fall from the back of his animal.
He made several attempts to speak, but before he could make
himself intelligible he broke off into immoderate laughter again.
Finally Crockett lost patience.</p>

<p>"You can stay there and laugh, while I go on."</p>

<p>"Hold on! hold on, Mister Crockett&mdash;ain't it fooney&mdash;but
I made&mdash;haw! haw! haw!&mdash;one great mistake&mdash;haw! haw!&mdash;<i>dish
is de wrong path, and we're furder away from de settlement
dan when we shtarted! haw! haw! haw! haw! haw! haw!</i>"</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span>JOURNEYING UNDER DIFFICULTIES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Hans Bungslager certainly had a remarkable appreciation
of a joke, and although something like anger rose in Crockett's
breast at the thought of the stupid mistake that had been made,
he could only grin and wait in silence until his outburst of
merriment was ended, when he inquired:</p>

<p>"Are you sartin that we ain't right after all?"</p>

<p>"Dish ish de path dat goes round, and come back of my
house shust in front of it, and if we keeps on, te cabin will
run ag'inst us."</p>

<p>"Then we may as well turn back."</p>

<p>Crockett guided his horse carefully around the other so as
still to hold the lead, and after considerable trouble, Hans succeeded
in imitating him, and the return was begun.</p>

<p>It is never a very pleasant thing to find you have taken the
wrong road, and Colonel Crockett felt somewhat ruffled that
his companion should have misled him; but, after all, he did
not see as any thing was lost thereby.</p>

<p>He felt very grave doubts in his own mind of the wisdom
of this attempt to reach the settlement, when it was as good
as certain that the Comanches were ahead of him. At any
rate, there was no wisdom in seeking to do so, supported only
by Hans Bungslager.</p>

<p>Sebastian was as keen and skillful as he was brave. He
was intimately acquainted with every crook and turn of the
forest-paths, he had fought Comanches and Mexicans, and
some reliance could be placed upon him in an emergency like
this.</p>

<p>Pretty Katrina was far more valuable in the hour of danger
than was her thick-headed uncle; and by turning back, there
was the probability of joining them the sooner, provided they
had not already come up and passed the point where the two
paths joined.</p>

<p>This seemed so probable as to cause Crockett considerable
misgiving, and he turned about to make a proposition to the
Dutchman.</p>

<p>"You're so heavily-loaded, Hans, that it won't be safe for
your hoss to undertake to git up a trot, if he was able, which
I don't believe he is. So I'll gallop on ahead to meet the
folks, while you take your time. Are you agreeable?"</p>

<p>"Yaw."</p>

<p>Without waiting for any thing further, Crockett struck his
mustang into a gallop, his hoofs sounding upon the earth with
a dangerous loudness, when there was such necessity for silence
in all their movements.</p>

<p>A few minutes only were necessary to bring him back to
the main path, where he looked keenly about in the gloom
for some sign of his young friends; but none was to be seen,
and he heard only the sigh of the winds and the soft flow of
the creek.</p>

<p>Had they already passed?</p>

<p>The question was so important that Crockett thought himself
justified in taking rather imprudent means to answer; so
he galloped some distance down the path, and then reining
up, shouted:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Hilloa!</span>"</p>

<p>He repeated the call several times, and his voice echoed
among the trees with a startling force, but no welcome response
came back in the shape of a signal from Sebastian.
Then he dismounted from his horse, and advancing to where
the moonlight shone upon the ground, carefully scrutinized it
as an Indian does when looking for the signs of the passing
of a foe.</p>

<p>But he was unable to detect any thing at all, and so he retraced
his steps to the "junction," convinced that the lovers
were still between him and the cabin.</p>

<p>"Whoa! whoa! Doonderation! Why you don't shtop?"</p>

<p>As these excited words reached the ears of the hunter he
became sensible of a furious tearing forward of some animal,
and while he was looking up the path to see what it
meant, the horse of Hans Bungslager came forward on a trot,
that threatened to displace every thing upon her back, and
jolting the rider like so much jelly.</p>

<p>"Whoa! shtop him!" he called out, seeing Crockett.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked the latter, with a laugh, as he
turned his horse so as to head him off.</p>

<p>"He got scared at a pig bear back in te woods, and I can't
shtop him."</p>

<p>The animal was certainly frightened at something, and instead
of stopping before the obstruction placed in his path, he
shied sharply to the right. Hans was unprepared for this
movement, and he rolled over to the other side, bringing himself
to the ground, with the feather-bed upon top of him.
Leaving him to disengage himself as best he could, Crockett
made a dash for the horse just in time to catch his bridle.</p>

<p>"Doonder blitzen!" muttered Hans, as he staggered to his
feet, "what made you shtop de hoss so <i>chook up</i>?"</p>

<p>"That's the only way I see'd to do it. Are you hurt
any?"</p>

<p>"I dinks I am," replied the Dutchman, as he began feeling
of different parts of his person, "I prokes my pipe, and I
bu'sted two buttons off my coat behind, and I feels pad all
over of myself."</p>

<p>"If you will take my advice you'll strip off all there is on
this hoss."</p>

<p>"Vot I does shmit it?"</p>

<p>"Leave it here till you kin come back and get it; if you
keep it on the horse, and try to get it into the settlement,
you'll lose it and your scalp, too."</p>

<p>"Can't lose my skelp, 'cause I hain't got none to lose," replied
Hans, lifting his hat and showing his pate, white and
shining in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Crockett urged his proposition, and his comrade seemed
quite struck with it. He debated and hesitated awhile, but
finally consented, and, as the horse had become soothed and
quieted by this time, he stood still, while the different articles
were taken from his back.</p>

<p>They were carefully deposited under a large tree, standing
back some distance from the path, and then Hans remounted
his animal and took the reins in his hand.</p>

<p>By this time, Crockett began to feel some apprehension
about the lovers, who ought to have been on the spot before
this.</p>

<p>He made numerous inquiries of Hans, but learned very
little. The stolid Dutchman seemed certain that it was all
well with both of them, and that there was no cause for anxiety
about either.</p>

<p>"Sebastian&mdash;he so shmart de Injins can't cotch him."</p>

<p>"But Katrina?"</p>

<p>"She so purty dat nobody never didn't hurt her, and so
nobody won't never say nottin' to her&mdash;so she's all right."</p>

<p>"She's never had a pack of red-skins chasing her," replied
Crockett, who was any thing but satisfied with the situation
of things.</p>

<p>"Dat is why dey won't do it, den, no more."</p>

<p>"But, why are they hanging back so?"</p>

<p>"Dey ain't hangin' pack&mdash;dey hang forward. I dinks
Katrina ish lookin' fur de cow, Sebastian ish lookin' fur Katrina,
and te cow ish lookin' fur me, and we ish lookin' fur
all dem, and so we all keeps lookin'&mdash;yaw! yaw!"</p>

<p>"It seems to me we may as well wait here till they come&mdash;there
ain't any other way they can get to the settlement is
there?"</p>

<p>"Yaw."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Dey kin go down into Mexico, and den come round frough
de Mulf of Gexico, and come dat way&mdash;but den it ish furder
dan dis way isn't?"</p>

<p>"Is there any other straight path?"</p>

<p>"Dey kin go on t'oder sight de creek."</p>

<p>"I didn't know there was another path. Just as like as
not they have taken that and are several miles ahead."</p>

<p>"I don't dinks so."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Cause we hain't heard de cow-bell&mdash;dat go jingle-jingle."</p>

<p>"Let's go ahead, for I don't see any use in waiting here."</p>

<p>The hunter felt some impatience at the belief that he had
dallied away so much time, when it was more than probable
that the parties for whom he was waiting had long since
passed by on the other side.</p>

<p>Accordingly he started his horse along the path again, Hans
Bungslager following close in the rear.</p>

<p>"So his animile was skeared by a b'ar," mused the Tennesseean,
as he rode along and recalled the fright of the horse ridden
by his friend. "I wonder if he was as big a critter as I
shot yesterday? If he was I'd like to get a shot at him."</p>

<p>He held up his rifle in front of him, as he passed through
a small patch of moonlight, to make sure that the priming was
in good condition.</p>

<p>"She's allers ready," he mused, as he still held it. "I don't
like Injins, and I do like b'ars, and I'd a blamed sight rather
shoot one of the four-footed than one of the two-legged critters,
and if one should come 'long just now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hilloa!" called Hans again, in an unusually cautious voice.</p>

<p>"Well, what now?" asked Crockett, turning his head;
"don't speak too loud."</p>

<p>"My hoss is skeart ag'in."</p>

<p>"What by?"</p>

<p>"I dinks dat bear ish follerin' me," replied Hans, looking
affrightedly over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" was the excited demand of Crockett, who
thought no more of lovers or Indians. "Do you see him?"</p>

<p>"No, but I hears him valk, and the hoss he don't like it;
I dinks he pig bear or else he be Injin dat is trying to shteal
me."</p>

<p>"I guess it's more likely to be a red-skin than any thing
else," replied the Tennesseean, instantly becoming very circumspect
in his movements, "and whichever it is, I've got to use
my gun on 'em!"</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span>HEMMED IN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When young Sebastian Carsfield started in quest of Katrina
Duncan, it is not to be supposed that he would permit any thing
to delay him on the way.</p>

<p>The fact that she was alone, at such a dangerous time as
this, was enough to give wings to his feet, and in a short time
he crossed the clearing and stood in front of the cabin from
which they had departed a few hours before.</p>

<p>The thought that possibly there might be some of the Indians
here caused him suddenly to check his steps and spring
back to the cover of the wood, where he stood for several
minutes carefully scrutinizing the building and listening.</p>

<p>All was still, and satisfied that none of the Comanches had
yet reached the spot, he advanced boldly, and, drawing the
latch-string, entered. All was dark and quiet within, and he
called the name of his beloved several times without receiving
any response.</p>

<p>"She has not returned from looking after the cow," he concluded,
as he came out of the building again, and looked anxiously
around, uncertain what way to turn.</p>

<p>The thought that possibly danger threatened the house
caused him to leave the cabin, and, passing across the clearing,
take shelter in the shadow of the wood, where he could watch
without being watched in return.</p>

<p>He recollected that a cow of Hans Bungslager generally wore
a bell, the better to indicate her whereabouts in the woods, and
he listened in the hope of detecting that. Once or twice he
fancied he heard the <i>tinkle, tinkle</i>, but it was so faint that he
could not locate it, nor make certain that he was not mistaken.</p>

<p>In the mean time he was growing more anxious. Time
was of the utmost importance to him; there was little doubt
in his mind but that all these exposed houses of the settlers
would be visited by the Comanches, who moved with wonderful
celerity, and struck blows as quick and powerful as they
were merciless.</p>

<p>"Surely she will return to the building," he concluded, referring
to Katrina, "and finding her uncle gone, will hurry on
after him. Then what could have caused her delay?"</p>

<p>He was in this distressing anxiety when he started as he
saw a couple of figures advance from the wood, at no great
distance from where he was standing, and start directly across
the clearing toward the house.</p>

<p>A second glance only was needed for him to identify them
as Indians&mdash;Comanches who had left their mustangs somewhere
near at hand, and were paying this visit to the cabin.</p>

<p>The Texan watched them as eagerly as a cat watches a
mouse, and at the same time he was filled with the gravest
apprehension about Katrina, for this proved that the location
of Bungslager's cabin was known to the Comanches, and it
looked very probable that she had already fallen into their
hands.</p>

<p>The two Indians walked at a leisurely gait, and upon
reaching the cabin, knocked at the door, and in the stillness
he could distinctly hear the words, in broken English:</p>

<p>"White man, let brother in."</p>

<p>Then they knocked again.</p>

<p>"Poor Injin come long way&mdash;he tired&mdash;white brudder, let
him come in&mdash;won't stay long."</p>

<p>No response being made, one of the savages lifted the latch
and entered, and as a matter of course, was not long in discovering
that the cabin was deserted. The moonlight, too,
told the story of precipitate flight, as the red-skins could see
that their coming had been expected and prepared for.</p>

<p>Learning that much, there was nothing left for the Comanches
to do, except to come out again. Carsfield could
see them very distinctly, standing side by side, and the guttural
mumble of their voices was plainly audible, as they discussed
some point in their own tongue.</p>

<p>The Texan supposed it was as to whether they should burn
the building or not. He made up his mind that if they attempted
to do it, he would shoot the one who made the
first move, relying upon his knife and pistol to deal with the
other.</p>

<p>As it was, by changing his own position somewhat, he could
get both of them in range, and he nervously grasped his rifle,
asking himself whether he should make the shot or not. Two
considerations only restrained him.</p>

<p>It was probable that a large body of Comanches were within
call, and that the shot would be the signal for them to swarm
to the spot. If Katrina were still wandering somewhere in
the woods, her danger would be greatly increased, and so he
held the shot which, had he fired, would have changed the
whole course of succeeding events.</p>

<p>For something like fifteen minutes the red-skins occupied
their position, and then they walked away with the indifference
that had characterized their coming.</p>

<p>Carsfield had fought these daring marauders before, and it
was a great trial for him to permit them to walk away
unmolested when he had it in his power to punish them so well
for their temerity.</p>

<p>"However, they have spared the cabin, and if they will go
and stay away, I shall not trouble them," he muttered, as he
lowered his piece, and wondered what the next development
was to be.</p>

<p>All at once he heard the tinkle of the cow-bell!</p>

<p>It was unmistakable, and he started up, his heart fluttering
with fear and hope, for he concluded right away that Katrina
was driving the cow home, and the departing Indians had not
got far enough away to miss hearing it.</p>

<p>Fortunately it was from the opposite side of the clearing,
from where they disappeared, and it was approaching.</p>

<p>"She will soon be here," he added to himself, as he advanced
to meet her; "the unsuspicious creature has no idea
of the danger that threatens."</p>

<p>It never occurred to the Texan, in his excited condition,
that he was the one who ought to be suspicious, inasmuch as
the sound of the cow-bell had broken upon his ear too suddenly
to have been caused by the gradual approach of a cow.</p>

<p>He was too desirous of meeting Katrina Duncan to observe
those "points," which at another time, would have been
certain to have roused his alarm.</p>

<p>The bell showed that the wearer was close to the edge of
the wood, and from some whim which he could not explain
himself, the young man stepped back into the shadow and
waited for the cow to appear.</p>

<p>Fortunate indeed was it for him that he did so, for he had
scarcely taken refuge in the shelter of the wood, when a tall,
sinewy Comanche stepped into view, and in his hand he held
the identical cow-bell that had struck so pleasantly upon the
ear of the lover!</p>

<p>The latter could scarcely repress an exclamation of amazement
as he witnessed this, for he had not the remotest thought
of any such strategy as it signified. The Indian had been
the first to discover the cow, and after killing her, the bell
had been taken from her neck with the purpose of using it
as a decoy in drawing the owners on to their destruction.</p>

<p>Could it be possible that Katrina had taken the alarm in
time?</p>

<p>This was the question, Sebastian asked himself, as he narrowly
watched the dusky dog who was attempting this
piece of shameless deception. Dark as was the prospect, he
began to feel some hope that such might be the case.</p>

<p>Like a true lover, he believed the mental abilities of his
favorite unequaled by any one else, and taking lesson from
the stupidity of her uncle, she might have detected the nearness
of the Indians before they discovered her.</p>

<p>While these thoughts were passing through his mind, he
was watching the movements of the decoy. With the jingling
bell held in one hand, and his rifle in the other, he walked
across the clearing, turning his head expectantly toward the
cabin, as if expecting some response from that. He even
circled entirely around it, and then as if disgusted with the
failure of this enterprise upon his part, he, too, took his departure
into the woods, and the Texan was once more left
alone.</p>

<p>Alone and wrought up to a high pitch of excitement.
Several hours had already passed since the departure from the
cabin, and the party of four was separated into three companies,
hardly one knowing where to look for each other, and
not more than one understanding how great a danger menaced
them.</p>

<p>The young man was naturally filled with the greatest anxiety
to do something for his beloved, and with a desire to
get the rest away from the perilous spot, but his hands seemed
really to be tied.</p>

<p>He could only stand still as it were, and see the procession
go by without taking part in it.</p>

<p>To add to his discomfort, he now began to be haunted by the
thought that she had already discovered her danger, and had
followed after the party, starting at such a time as to miss
him.</p>

<p>So strong did this conviction become, that he had decided
to do the same, and make <i>that</i> point clear, when his acutely
sensitive ear caught the sound of a footstep directly behind him.</p>

<p>It was so soft and stealthy, that he was certain at once of
its being made by an Indian, and he sprung behind a tree to
protect himself.</p>

<p>"<i>Sebastian, it that you?</i>"</p>

<p>There was no mistaking <i>that</i> voice, and, trembling with joy
he moved forward in the gloom, calling out, in a fond but
cautious voice:</p>

<p>"My own Katrina, where are you?"</p>

<p>"Here, right before you."</p>

<p>And the next instant she was clasped in his arms.</p>

<p>"Safe and unharmed!" he exclaimed, as he kissed her cold
forehead. "I was in despair about you."</p>

<p>"Where are uncle and Colonel Crockett?"</p>

<p>"Gone on toward the village."</p>

<p>"And why are you here?"</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I could desert <i>you</i> when in danger, my
dearest one? Have I ever given you cause for such a suspicion?"</p>

<p>"No, dearest Sebastian; but what shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Let us follow them at once."</p>

<p>"We can not take the path, for I tried to do so twice,
and each time was forced to turn back."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"The Comanches are watching for us there!"</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span>A GLEAM OF HOPE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>"If that is the case," said the Texan, "we must take a
roundabout way to get out of here. The Indians seem to be
getting plentier every minute."</p>

<p>"You must be careful about making any noise, for you
know what keen ears they have."</p>

<p>"Never fear about me," replied the Texan; "keep close
and walk quietly as I do."</p>

<p>They began stealing around the edge of the clearing in
search of another path very rarely traveled, and which, it was
reasonable to suppose, was unknown to the Indians. They
had taken scarcely a dozen steps, however, when the young
man heard a rustling footstep just in front of him, and instantly
stopped.</p>

<p>The next second he discovered several figures coming toward
him, and self-preservation made him wheel on his foot
so rapidly, that it was impossible to avoid making a little
noise.</p>

<p>Slight as it was it caught the ear of the Comanches, one of
whom uttered a "woofh!" and moved rapidly toward him.</p>

<p>"Run for the house!" exclaimed Sebastian to Katrina, when
he saw the shape affairs had assumed; "hold the door ready
for me, and I'll follow in a minute."</p>

<p>There was no time for hesitation, and the light-footed girl
started for the house, running as she did when pursued by the
ravenous bear. Discovery was inevitable, and the instant she
emerged into the moonlight, two Comanches, repeating the
"woofh!" dashed out after her.</p>

<p>But a lion appeared in the way, in shape of the Texan, who,
brandishing his terrible Bowie over his head, leaped in front,
with a regular screech of a yell, and made a murderous lunge
with the weapon at the nearest Comanche, who dodged it
with the nimbleness of an athlete.</p>

<p>Sebastian made a sort of back-handed sweep at the other
red-skin, who avoided the blow with the same astonishing dexterity,
and drew back to a respectful distance.</p>

<p>This demonstration on the part of the Texan had the effect
of checking the rush after Katrina, who continued on her way,
without pausing, until, reaching the cabin, she dashed in, and
holding the door, so that she could close it in an instant,
looked out upon the thrilling scene.</p>

<p>While the defensive, defiant attitude of the brave defender
kept the two Comanches from him, it did not "neutralize"
their abilities by any means. They too had knives, but the
two together were not the equal of the Bowie, in the hands
of the wiry Texan; but their voices remained to them, and
the two set up some whoops and yells of such a peculiar character,
that the young man knew at once that they were intended
as signals, and they would be certain to bring others
speedily to their assistance.</p>

<p>So he began retreating toward the cabin, walking backward,
and presenting a defiant attitude to his enemies, who,
following close, still permitted a safe gap between them and
him.</p>

<p>Now and then the Texan threw a quick glance over his
shoulder, to make sure that none of the treacherous red-skins
were stealing upon him. He was within a rod or so of the
house, when he saw what he dreaded.</p>

<p>Some half a dozen Indians were hurrying to the spot, coming
almost directly from the rear, so that, if he remained where
he was, he was quite sure to be surrounded, and cut off entirely
from reaching the house.</p>

<p>Such a thing would have been madness upon the part of
Sebastian, who instantly turned, and ran at the top of his
speed toward the house, both parties of Indians converging in
swift pursuit.</p>

<p>Katrina was on the look-out for him, and the instant he
reached the door, it was drawn open to admit him, and then
closed as quickly. She was prepared for such a crisis as this,
and swift as came the Comanches, by the time they threw
themselves against the door, the massive fastenings were in
their place, and it presented as immovable a front to the assault,
as the side of the cabin itself.</p>

<p>There was only one window upon the lower floor, and as
soon as the Texan was certain of the door, he ran to this,
reaching it scarcely a moment too soon; for the head and
shoulders of a sinewy Indian were already through the opening.</p>

<p>The next minute, the body of the savage dropped back to
the ground, as limp and lifeless as a log of wood.</p>

<p>The Bowie-knife had done its work!</p>

<p>This decided repulse of the Comanches had the result of
making them more cautious. The whole party, numbering
nearly a dozen, scattered like a covey of partridges across the
clearing until they reached the wood, where they gathered
together to consult how this fearful man was to be routed out
and their fallen companion avenged.</p>

<p>Sebastian gazed after them and saw one of the men as he
skurried away, bearing the body of the victim upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>Confident that they would speedily return to the assault, the
Texan stationed himself in the lower room, rifle in hand,
ready to pick off the first savage that exposed himself, while
Katrina went to the upper story, which, having a window
upon each side, gave a better outlook than from below.</p>

<p>As yet, the lovers had scarcely exchanged a word since entering
the building, except that he gave a few hurried directions,
during the first five minutes. The common danger was
too great for wooing and winning at such a time.</p>

<p>The respite now granted by the Comanches gave the young
man a little time to collect his thoughts and take in the "situation."</p>

<p>When he came to reflect upon what he had done, the conviction
came to him that a mistake had been made. By taking to
the woods, he could have vanquished the two red-skins who
attacked, and then got away with Katrina in the darkness before
the others could come up. Thus clear of all danger, and
in the protecting shadows of the wood, he could easily put
her out of the reach of her foes before the dawn of morning.</p>

<p>But what had they done?</p>

<p>Nothing less than shut themselves in the cabin, where the
red-skins, if they chose to wait, could "gobble" them up at their
leisure.</p>

<p>Sebastian reflected that there was not a mouthful of food
in the house, nor a drop of water, as it had been cleared of
both, before the principal furniture was removed. If the Indians
chose to remain were they were for a few days, their
prey would drop like ripe fruit into their hands.</p>

<p>But suppose, as was most probably the case, that they did
not intend to make a siege, what then?</p>

<p>There was only a single gun in the house, while there were
so many on the outside, Indian ingenuity could devise a safe
means of getting so near the cabin, that it would be about impossible
to use this or any other weapon, and then they could
go to work, make their preparations and burn down the
structure.</p>

<p>As to the prospect of a rescue, the Texan saw none at all.
These was no military force at all in this part of the Republic,
and of those who were able to reach the settlement, it was
not to be supposed that any would venture out, while there was
any reason to believe the Comanches were anywhere within
striking distance.</p>

<p>The situation was desperate at the best, but like a brave
man he had no thought of surrender, so long as he had a hand
to raise in the defense of himself and of her who was dearer
to him than his own life.</p>

<p>Fully an hour passed, and not the slightest sign of an Indian
was seen. Sebastian grew tired of watching alone, and
ascended to the upper room to join Katrina.</p>

<p>The moonlight which entered the different windows, made
it quite light here, and he saw her at once as she came forward
to meet him. He pressed her to his heart, and imprinting a
kiss upon her cheek, led her back to the window at which she
was standing when he entered.</p>

<p>"We are in a bad fix," he said.</p>

<p>"There is hope, I trust."</p>

<p>"I can not see any, or very little at least."</p>

<p>"Will they not leave after such a repulse?"</p>

<p>"I see no hope of it."</p>

<p>"They are moving very rapidly, and will not linger long in
this neighborhood. You know the Comanches go as quickly
as they come."</p>

<p>"Not always; we have slain one of their number, and they
will get even with us if possible. If they can manage to put
me out of the way, I have no doubt they will be satisfied to
take you and go."</p>

<p>"Oh, Sebastian!" she exclaimed, in a reproving, tender
voice, "why do you speak so lightly of so terrible a thing?
Do you think I could live after your death?"</p>

<p>"I don't doubt your love, dearest, and I shall stay here and
fight to the death for you; but, at such a time as this, there
is nothing to be gained by shutting our eyes to the truth."</p>

<p>"And you think the chances are against our escape?"</p>

<p>"Decidedly so; indeed, I see no prospect at all. I would
rather fight fifty Mexicans than a half-dozen of these Comanches.
They are so nimble, that it is the hardest thing in the world
to hit one of them, and they know how to strike out for
themselves, and have got ten times the courage of a greaser."</p>

<p>"And have they no mercy?"</p>

<p>"Mercy! I should like to see a red-skin with such a thing
as mercy. I have never come across one as yet. I am only
sorry that I didn't pitch into those two fellows, and then take
to the woods with you, before the others came up; but, as it
is, we must fight it out to the bitter end with them."</p>

<p>Katrina started.</p>

<p>"Oh, I have thought of something!" she exclaimed, in an
eager and glad voice.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I think I see a way of escape."</p>

<p>Her tones and manner showed that she was in earnest, and
a slight flutter of hope came to her lover at the thought.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span>A STRANGE DELIVERANCE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>There was contagion in the manner of Katrina, and her
lover wondered very much what she could mean. She replied
by leading him to the window and pointing toward the edge
of the woods, opposite to the side upon which the Comanches
had retreated.</p>

<p>"I see nothing," he said, "except the cellar, where your
uncle has been in the habit of keeping his potatoes and cabbage."</p>

<p>"That's just what I want you to see; for there is our means
of escape&mdash;at least I <i>hope</i> so."</p>

<p>Sebastian looked at the girl in amazement.</p>

<p>"I don't understand you; if you have any thing to tell me,
Katrina, don't speak in riddles."</p>

<p>"What I have to ask is this; if there was any way by
which we could reach that mound, do you think we could get
off unobserved from there?"</p>

<p>The young man scanned the hillock of earth very closely
for a few moments.</p>

<p>"It might be done," he replied, a moment later. "I notice
a lot of bushes just back of it, which seem to reach almost to
the woods."</p>

<p>"They do so entirely; they are currant bushes, planted by
me several years ago. They reach entirely to the forest."</p>

<p>"Under their shadow, one might manage to steal to the
woods. At any rate, I think I could do it; but why talk of
such a thing?" he asked, somewhat impatiently, "when from
here to the potato cellar, the ground is as hard and level as a
door, and they could see a cat stealing along."</p>

<p>"Between the house and the cellar there is an <i>underground
communication</i>, which uncle Hans made last summer. Why
he did it I can not tell, but I have been through it several
times."</p>

<p>Sebastian sprung to his feet in delight.</p>

<p>"Is it possible? Why didn't you tell me of it before?
We will try it at once; we will make it a success."</p>

<p>"Suppose the Comanches come before we get away, will
they not be likely to find out where we have gone?"</p>

<p>"Possibly they might. Suppose you go first, and I will
keep watch until you are ready for me."</p>

<p>Another difficulty presented itself at this point, although it
did not amount to a great deal. The door which opened
above-ground into the cellar, was on the side toward the house,
and opening outward, would be pretty certain to attract the
notice of the vigilant Indians.</p>

<p>"How thick are the walls?" asked Sebastian.</p>

<p>"They are lined with boards."</p>

<p>"They can be easily displaced, I have no doubt, and, as
we shall have to make a new opening, I will go into the cellar
with you."</p>

<p>"Let us do so then without any delay."</p>

<p>The Texan concluded to make a survey from each window
before going, and he did so, scrutinizing every part of the
clearing and wood with all the care possible.</p>

<p>It seemed to the Texan that perhaps the Comanches while
waiting had gained the idea that the defenders of the house
were off their guard and asleep; so, to prevent any action
from any such presumption, he fired his gun toward the wood,
and then reloading his piece turned to Katrina.</p>

<p>"I don't think they will disturb the house for some time;
let us go at once."</p>

<p>Down-stairs they went, and then into the cellar beneath
the lower floor. Here, of course, every thing was of pitchy
darkness, and Sebastian was led by the hand by Katrina, who
was familiar with every step of the way.</p>

<p>The passage leading from the main cellar to that where the
potatoes and cabbage (their bulk generally being too great to
admit them beneath the house) was about thirty feet in extent,
and its excavation must have caused Hans Bungslager a
great deal of labor.</p>

<p>As they walked through the cool passage, both were compelled
to stoop quite low to prevent striking their heads; but
the passage required but a few minutes, when they came
within the large cavern-like opening used for storage-room,
but which at this season was almost empty.</p>

<p>"Well, here we are!" said the young man. "There's the
door, for I can see the moonlight shining through it, and right
opposite is where we must dig ourselves out."</p>

<p>"Will it not be safe to use the door? I am afraid it will
delay us too much."</p>

<p>"It is running too much risk; I think we can shortly dig
our way out."</p>

<p>Groping around with his hands, he speedily got hold of
the planking, and only a little exertion was necessary to draw
it loose. Then nothing but a mass of soft earth was between
them and the outside.</p>

<p>The Texan used the plank as a shovel, and driving it into
the earth, speedily loosened so much that an alarming yawn
occurred&mdash;much larger than was anticipated and such that
both were afraid it would attract the attention of their enemies.</p>

<p>They paused and listened, but, hearing nothing, Sebastian
cautiously peered out. Every thing was quiet, and he could
not see any evidence that suspicious eyes were turned upon
them. Then telling Katrina to wait until he reached the
wood, he as carefully drew himself out, and lay flat upon the
ground.</p>

<p>Fortunately he was directly beside the vigorous currant
bushes, which interposed an effectual screen against the observation
of those upon the other side, while its heavy shadow
gave him enough obscurity to prevent his being seen by any
foes from the other direction unless their attention was especially
directed to the spot. Both were dressed in dark
clothes, and their hearts beat high with hope.</p>

<p>Sebastian had replaced his Bowie down his back, and holding
his rifle in his left hand, he began the perilous journey.</p>

<p>He had almost fifty feet to travel, and he did it with the
skill of a veteran scout of the plains&mdash;creeping along foot by
foot, pausing and listening and looking on every side of him.
As he neared the somber and welcome shadow of the wood,
he was strongly tempted to hasten his progress, and had he
been alone he might have done so.</p>

<p>But the last yard of the dangerous trip was made with the
same deliberation and care as the others. He breathed more
freely when he passed the clearing, but his anxiety still remained,
as Katrina was yet to follow.</p>

<p>She had kept her eyes fixed upon his form, so long as she
was able to see him. At times his progress was so slow or
was checked that she feared he had been discovered; but,
when about in despair, she could see that he was moving
again. By and by her strained eyes failed to identify him in
the gloom, as he gradually receded, and she could only conjecture
when he got to the wood. She listened for some signal,
but hearing none, concluded every thing favorable, and
then she began her task.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, Sebastian stood in the edge of the
wood watching her movements with an intensity of interest
which can scarcely be understood. He could see her as
she emerged from the cabin, when the same shadow that
enveloped him, hid her from view, until she had advanced
quite a distance along the path.</p>

<p>"If any Comanche wants to commit suicide, let him interfere
with her," muttered the Texan, as he stood with rifle in
hand, watching her progress.</p>

<p>But fortune favored them. The red-skins were indeed
keeping a watch, but it was a watch upon the house, in
which, of course, they supposed the whites were still at bay.</p>

<p>Katrina accomplished the whole distance in safety, and, at
length, entered the wood, rose to her feet and stood beside
her lover.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!" he exclaimed, as he clasped her in his
arms. "I was in an agony of fear until this moment."</p>

<p>"We are not safe yet," she whispered, looking affrightedly
round in the darkness, "they must be somewhere near us."</p>

<p>"Come on," said the young man, taking her hand, "I think
we can avoid them."</p>

<p>Instead of making directly for the path, he led her by a
circuitous route, and struck it at a point a couple of hundred
yards distant.</p>

<p>From this place they moved stealthily forward, and soon
found that it was free from their foes. They advanced with
great care, and not until they had gone fully a half-mile did
they converse with any thing like freedom.</p>

<p>"I think we are safe from <i>them</i>," said the young man,
somewhat exultingly, referring to the red-skins whom they
had left behind them.</p>

<p>"How long will they wait there?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps they will stay a day or two in the hope of starving
us out, or they may make an assault in force and discover
the trick that has been played upon them."</p>

<p>"And then what will they do?"</p>

<p>"Set fire to the cabin and leave."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," replied Katrina with a sigh. "It is sad,
but I am thankful that we are not included in the ruin."</p>

<p>"How was it you kept out of their way so well, before we
met?" asked the Texan, with some curiosity.</p>

<p>"I was searching for the cow, and I was not long in finding
her dead, killed by a bullet. Then of course I knew the
Comanches were close at hand, and I hurried to the house
to warn uncle Hans of his danger, but found he had already
gone. As he had a heavy load on the horse, and could move
only very slowly, I knew I could overtake him, whenever I
wished to do so. So I remained to see what the Indians
were going to do.</p>

<p>"I felt able to keep out of the way, and was doing so,
when I thought I saw you. I managed to approach near
enough to be sure, and I made myself known, and you know
the rest."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the lover, squeezing her hand in his. "I
know the rest indeed. We have been spared by Providence,
and have made a remarkable escape from the beleaguered
cabin. The Comanches are still abroad, and there must be
many of them between us and Brownston; your uncle Hans
is not the sharpest woodman in the world, but I trust that
when we all get together, as I hope we shall speedily do,
a way will be opened for all of us to reach a place of safety."</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span>IN THE WOOD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It will be recollected that Colonel Crockett and Hans
Bungslager were left under the conviction that a bear was
close behind them in the path, and that the Tennesseean, true
to his instincts, dismounted and started back rifle in hand in
quest of the game.</p>

<p>"I dinks I goes, too," muttered the Dutchman, as he slid
off the back of his beast. "I would rather fight mit a bear,
den haf te hoss run away mit me, and catch a limb under
my chin, and take off my head off&mdash;yaw, dat so."</p>

<p>Hans held his gun in hand, and he resolved, if he could
gain the chance, to shoot the bear in advance of his companion.
He thought it would be a good joke to play upon
him.</p>

<p>So as Colonel Crockett moved stealthily along the path,
the corpulent Hollander did the same to the best of his ability;
stepping so lightly and rapidly, that it made it quite a
task for him, and he puffed and panted like a tired dog.</p>

<p>"Confound it!" growled Crockett, turning his head. "Can't
you keep still?"</p>

<p>"Dat ish what I is doing," was the reply. "I doesn't
make no noise."</p>

<p>"You will frighten away the game."</p>

<p>"Dat ish a lie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Sh! there it is."</p>

<p>Hans caught sight of something dark, moving along the
path, and instantly raised his blunderbuss and fired, narrowly
missing taking off the head of Colonel Crockett in front of
him. He did not strike the object, or come anywhere near
it, but he produced a response, like a six-pounder.</p>

<p>"There! that will do; we don't propose to hurt you."</p>

<p>It was the voice of Sebastian, the Texan, and, as may be
supposed, was a surprise and delight to the others.</p>

<p>"Where did I hit you? In te head, or in te heart?" inquired
Hans Bungslager, with some solicitude.</p>

<p>"It is hard to tell precisely where I was hit," was the
laughing reply; "at any rate, I am not dangerously hurt,
as far as I know. Your slugs struck in the tree overhead
like a hail-storm."</p>

<p>"Where ish Katrina?"</p>

<p>"Here she is, uncle," replied the buxom girl herself, hurrying
forward, and giving the old fellow a good embrace and
kiss.</p>

<p>"You must be more careful," said Hans, in an impressive
voice. "S'pose I hit you, instead of Sebastian? You couldn't
stand it petter as he does."</p>

<p>"We were very careful; how could we do differently?"</p>

<p>"Te next time dat you ish coming in front of us behind,
you must come on peforehand and tells us dat you ish
comin'&mdash;den we knows it, and we no shoot de next time.
Understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Katrina, in a dazed sort of way, as she
turned and took the hand of Colonel Crockett, who was
heartily glad to see her.</p>

<p>"We were gittin' a little anxious about you," said he, as
he warmly shook the hand; "we heard the noise of guns and
there was no telling where the varmints war, or what they
was doing. I've fout the Creek Injins under old Gineral
Jackson, and I've fout Old Hickory himself in Congress, and
got licked by him too, so you can see I've been through some
purty rough scrimmages in my time; but they say these Comanches
are a little worse than all, and that being the case,
you can understand why I'm so glad to see you."</p>

<p>Katrina modestly thanked him, while the Texan gave a
brief summary of their experience during the last few hours.</p>

<p>The question now arose as to what course should be taken
by the fugitives. Crockett believed that an attempt to push
on into the village would result in the capture of the entire
party, while to stay where they were would be equally fatal,
as there was the strongest evidence that the Comanches were
very near them.</p>

<p>Indeed, the wonder was that they were unmolested at that
very moment, for some of the red-skins had passed over that
very spot, and how the whites had escaped detection and capture
so long was a mystery to Crockett.</p>

<p>"I ain't particular what we do," said he; "I only know
we've got to get out of this part of creation."</p>

<p>"Let's go on further, any way," replied the Texan, starting
on foot, with Katrina.</p>

<p>"Where ish te cow?" suddenly inquired Bungslager, just
after he had laboriously climbed back upon his animal.</p>

<p>"We couldn't bring her very well," replied the Texan; "I
think she will wait where she is till we come back."</p>

<p>"Dat is goot ash never vos," replied the contented Hollander;
"she wash always a goot cow and shtood shtill, only
when she kicked te pail over, and dat wash every time we
milked, 'ceptin Sundays, when she kicked te pail and me over
bofe."</p>

<p>The young man being thoroughly acquainted with the path,
and having fought Comanches before, very properly took the
lead, Katrina following close behind him, while Crockett came
next, and Hans Bungslager brought up the rear.</p>

<p>In this order they started, and, as the horse of the Dutchman
was relieved of his bulky load of furniture, the party
progressed at a good pace, and without any unusual clatter or
noise.</p>

<p>Stupid, thoughtless and reckless as Hans Bungslager naturally
was, with his love for fun and jollity outrunning every
thing else, he still had a perception (such as it was) of the
danger that menaced them all, and he showed a spasmodic
discretion at times.</p>

<p>His little pony, as fat, round and well-preserved as himself,
seemed to comprehend the situation, and walked along with a
steady, quiet step, that was not heard as often as the quicker
and more nervous tread of Crockett's mustang. Hans himself
was still, a rather unusual thing for him.</p>

<p>Once or twice he started up a whistle, without thinking,
but he suddenly recalled himself to his senses, and preserved
his peace as well as the others.</p>

<p>He was subject to one annoyance, rather curious in its way.
Every now and then a conviction came over him that something
was following him. Sometimes he fancied that a Comanche
was stealing on tip-toe, with tomahawk in hand, ready
to hurl it at his bald pate. More than once he turned his
head suddenly, expecting to confront the ugly phantom, but
it seemed to whisk out of sight before he could fix his vision
upon it.</p>

<p>Then he was certain it was a huge black bear, lumbering
along, and only waiting for the opportunity to leap upon the
haunches of his horse and claw them both to pieces.</p>

<p>This was curious, as Hans Bungslager was one of the least
imaginative of men, and was rarely troubled with nightmare
or phantoms of the brain, but the feeling followed him like
his own shadow, and would not be shaken off.</p>

<p>He determined to wait until sure of what it was, and then
to turn suddenly and shoot it. There was no danger now of
hitting Katrina, Sebastian or any of his friends, for they were
all in front of him. It must be an enemy beyond all question,
and therefore it was his duty to put a ball through it at
the very first opportunity.</p>

<p>The party had gone some distance, when a light was observed
in the sky, of so lurid a character, as to show that there
was some large conflagration.</p>

<p>"See what we have escaped," whispered the Texan, as he
turned to look at it, and ventured to press the hand of the
girl beside him.</p>

<p>"Have they found out that we have fled?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, and perhaps not; they wouldn't hesitate to
roast us in such a bonfire, if they could only get the opportunity."</p>

<p>"It is then our house that is burning?"</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt of it. There is no other building
near it, and the light is in precisely the same spot. It is good-by
to your home now."</p>

<p>"Uncle Hans will mourn its loss, but how can I, when
Heaven has been so merciful to me?"</p>

<p>"He will have to build another; <i>you</i> will not!"</p>

<p>"But I will assist him."</p>

<p>"But there's a little cottage in Brownston, already finished,
around which the honeysuckles and woodbine clamber, that is
to be <i>your</i> home."</p>

<p>As the lover spoke, he leaned over in the darkness, and
kissed the cheek that was not turned away from him.</p>

<p>Beyond the danger and darkness that enveloped them both,
he saw the rainbow of hope. There was a sky all sunshine
that was only a short distance away, and with the darling
beautiful, loved Katrina by his side, there was nothing that
could cloud or make him unhappy.</p>

<p>Hans Bungslager saw the light, but he had no suspicion
that it was his own building that was on fire, else he would
not have been so quiet, as he rode upon his horse.</p>

<p>The whites paused but a few moments, when they resumed
their journey, moving with the same caution that had characterized
their actions from the first.</p>

<p>They were rapidly nearing a large clearing, where stood another
settler's house, and where there was reason to fear
that some of the wandering Comanches had made their appearance.
No light in the sky betrayed the work of the
torch, but that was no proof that the destroyer was not there
that minute.</p>

<p>The Texan gave a word of caution to those in the rear, and
when the lighting up of the spaces between the trees tokened
their approach to the clearing, he requested all to remain still
while he advanced and made a reconnoissance.</p>

<p>This was done, and he stole along as softly and timidly as
when making his way from the cabin of Hans Bungslager.</p>

<p>Reaching the clearing, he saw the settler's house, standing
as quiet and undisturbed as though no danger had ever threatened
it. No sounds were audible, but there were no lights to
be seen. Sebastian came to the conclusion that the owner and
his family had taken the alarm in time and had fled to
Brownston.</p>

<p>Still it was important that no mistake should be committed,
and he made his reconnoissance complete, by advancing up to
the very house, and even peering into the interior. The result
confirmed his first impression. There were no whites in
them, and he returned to his friends with his report to that
effect.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span>A STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The Texan having rendered his report, the party made ready
to move on again, when a rather alarming discovery was
made.</p>

<p>Hans Bungslager was nowhere to be found!</p>

<p>There stood his horse, as quiet and unconcerned as though
nothing extraordinary had happened, but his rider was missing.</p>

<p>What did it mean?</p>

<p>This was the question which the three asked each other,
and which no one was able to answer.</p>

<p>"He came up and talked with us a few minutes, while you
were gone," said Katrina, who was more alarmed than the others,
"and then said he would go back and get on his horse so
as to be ready to start if all should prove right, and that is
the last we saw of him."</p>

<p>"Did he say nothing about going away?" asked the Texan.</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>"What did he talk about?"</p>

<p>"Nothing in particular," said Katrina, trying to recall his
words.</p>

<p>"I remember," put in Colonel Crockett, "that he said that
he believed something was follerin' him&mdash;either a bear or red-skin."</p>

<p>"That makes it look serious," remarked Sebastian, in an
undertone.</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"Because probably something was following, and that something
has been the means of his disappearance."</p>

<p>"I don't see as there's any thing in that," added Colonel
Crockett, "for he talked the same way when you and Katrina
came up."</p>

<p>"Exactly, and he was right, for we were in his rear, and he
detected us."</p>

<p>"But what could it be?" asked his alarmed niece. "No
Indian could have come anywhere near without our detecting
him."</p>

<p>"Not unless he wanted us to do so; then it would have been
easy enough. I tell you," added the Texan, more earnestly
than ever, "I believe there has been some sharp trick played
upon us."</p>

<p>Carsfield was firm in his belief, but he could give no definite
conjecture as to what the trick he referred to really was.</p>

<p>"I have had dealings with the Comanches before," he continued,
"and when they go to scheming and playing at strategy,
they are a little the sharpest fellows I ever saw."</p>

<p>"But I can see no object in this," said Katrina. "Uncle
Hans is not such a tempting prize that they should steal him
and leave us."</p>

<p>"That is it," laughed Crockett; "when <i>you</i> are here, any
red or white man would pass by us for <i>you</i>; you are right,
Katrina."</p>

<p>"That is not what I meant," the blushing girl hastened to
say; "but he is the last man, as I look at it, that a party of
Indians would seek to capture."</p>

<p>"Our turn, <i>your</i> turn, my dearest one, will soon come. They
have experimented on him; they have succeeded so well that
their next attempt will be upon us."</p>

<p>The words of Sebastian struck both Crockett and Katrina as
full of meaning, and they began to believe that he was right,
although the whole thing had a look which, neither of the
three could explain or understand.</p>

<p>When the Comanches were in such force, that an assault
upon the whiles could not but result in their capture or destruction,
it seemed incredible that they should take the pains
and time to work by artifice; but by what other means could
the disappearance of the Dutchman be accounted for?</p>

<p>"How was it done?" asked the perplexed girl, who was in
a tremor of anxiety about her uncle.</p>

<p>"That is a question which can only be answered by a
guess," was the reply. "I think one of the red scamps has
followed us some distance, and showed himself in some way
or in some shape to Hans, so that he has been led to follow
after and attempt to capture him, and that's what he's after
now."</p>

<p>This at best was a very unsatisfactory explanation, and it
did not suit the originator of it himself.</p>

<p>"Must we leave him to his fate?" asked the girl, scarcely
able to restrain her tears of sympathy; "must he be left to
perish?"</p>

<p>"I dislike the idea of leaving you again," replied Sebastian,
"when we are all in such danger; but, if you wish it, I
will take the back track, and make a short hunt for him."</p>

<p>"Oh! do," pleaded Katrina, taking one of his hands in
both of hers and pressing it; "do it for my sake. Colonel
Crockett will wait here with me, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Sartinly&mdash;any thing to please you," was the gallant reply.
"I think, howsumever, that it is all time lost."</p>

<p>But the affectionate girl would hear no refusal, and the
Texan prepared to obey.</p>

<p>"You must promise me that you will not leave this place,
and that you will not fire again unless you have to do so to
save yourself," he said, addressing himself to Colonel Crockett,
who, of course, gave the promise.</p>

<p>"You are now standing in the path," added the Texan.
"Perhaps it will be safer to withdraw a little to one side, so
as to be out of the way of any that may come along."</p>

<p>This was a good advice, and was acted upon at once.
Crockett led the horses some distance into the woods and fastened
them to trees, where they were beyond the sight of the
keenest-eyed Comanche, and then their friend took his departure.</p>

<p>Katrina was in a tremor of alarm, and seating herself beside
the Tennesseean, wept like a child. The grizzled
wanderer did his best to comfort her, but there was little he
could say to soothe her alarm, and so he let her have her cry
out.</p>

<p>When something like a calm came back to her, it struck
him that something ought be done by way of diverting her attention
from the gloomy subject.</p>

<p>"Let's go to the edge of the clearing, and see whether any
of the varmints are about?"</p>

<p>She arose, and the two advanced to the open space, where
the low, broad deserted cabin could be seen, standing as quiet
in the moonlight as when they first cast eyes upon it.</p>

<p>"Hallo! there's something now!" whispered Crockett, touching
the arm of the girl, "and by the hokey-pokey, if it ain't a
big bear!"</p>

<p>A large lumbering animal could be seen, shambling awkwardly
over the clearing near the house, as though he were
searching for something to eat.</p>

<p>The great bear-hunter impulsively raised his gun.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Just wait a moment, and see how nice I will drop that
chap."</p>

<p>"No; you mustn't," she interrupted, drawing down his
arm. "Remember the promise you made to Sebastian."</p>

<p>"But he didn't mean bears," plead Crockett, very loth to
forego the pleasure of picking off the noble game.</p>

<p>"He meant every thing; he meant that you mustn't make the
least noise to bring the Comanches down upon us, and <i>you
mustn't do it</i>!"</p>

<p>By this time the bear had disappeared around the house,
and the hunter reluctantly lowered his piece.</p>

<p>"Would thar be any harm," he asked, entreatingly, "in
me slipping after the critter, and chasing him away off in
the woods, and then dropping him?"</p>

<p>"And leaving me alone?"</p>

<p>"Ah, me!" sighed Crockett, "I s'pose you're right, but b'ars
is my weakness, and when I see one, thar's such an itching in
my hands, that it's mighty hard work to keep still, but I'll
stick to you, till we get out of this muss."</p>

<p>He asked as a boon, however, that she would consent to
his standing where he was so as to <i>look</i> at the bear, if he
should put in an appearance again.</p>

<p>Katrina could not well refuse this, but she took good care
to remain with him, for after what she had witnessed, it was
plain that he could not be trusted, in the matter of bears.</p>

<p>Crockett stood faithful at his post for half an hour, carefully
scanning the clearing, forgetful of the absent Bungslager,
and Sebastian, and of his own danger, and intent only upon
seeing the animal which he had hunted with so much zest in
the years past in the wilds of his own Tennessee.</p>

<p>But nothing more of the huge creature was seen, and turning
disappointedly away, he and Katrina walked back in the
wood, resumed their seats, and awaited the coming of the
young Texan.</p>

<p>About an hour had passed, and they were beginning to feel
some solicitude for the safety of the Texan himself, when he
reappeared as silently as an Indian hunter.</p>

<p>But he was alone.</p>

<p>"Have you learned nothing of him?" inquired the trembling
Katrina, hastening to her lover.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," was the reply, as he took her two hands,
and kissed her face. "I went back for nearly a mile, and
called to him a dozen times, but heard and saw nothing at all
that could give me the least clue to his disappearance."</p>

<p>The poor girl covered her face and gave a wail of despair.</p>

<p>"Did you see nothing of the varmints?" inquired Crockett.</p>

<p>"No; I hardly know what to make of it; I am quite
puzzled at the turn affairs have taken."</p>

<p>So were they all, and the question remained:</p>

<p>"What shall we do?"</p>

<span>BY THE CREEK.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The general opinion among the whites was that nothing
was to be gained by pushing on toward Brownston, at the
present time.</p>

<p>They were now within a few miles of the village, and were
pretty well satisfied that they would have to run a regular
gantlet to pass the Comanches. Such a proceeding was not
to be thought of so long as it could be avoided.</p>

<p>"It won't do to turn back, nor to go forward, nor to stay
here," remarked the young man, after quite a lengthy discussion.</p>

<p>"Isn't there some place, further in the woods," asked
Crockett, "where the varmints ain't likely to look for us?"</p>

<p>They were silent a few minutes, and then Katrina suddenly
spoke:</p>

<p>"Do you remember that cavern, Sebastian, where we once
halted when we went fishing in the canoe?"</p>

<p>"The very spot," exclaimed the Texan, "and we can't be far
from it. We will leave our horses here and go to it."</p>

<p>"But tell me," she added, in a low voice, intended for his
ears only, "what about Uncle Hans? Is he to be left to
perish?"</p>

<p>He turned his face toward her and spoke in the tenderest
manner:</p>

<p>"You know, Katrina, that there is nothing in the world
that I would refuse to do for you; and you will believe me,
when I tell you that nothing in the world can be done for
him. We are powerless to aid him in the least."</p>

<p>"But what do <i>you</i> think of it?"</p>

<p>"I have a strong belief that he will turn up all right in
spite of the bad look it has now. It is painful to you, but it
can not be helped."</p>

<p>"You will hear nothing more from me about it," she replied,
"so long as other matters command your thoughts."</p>

<p>It was deemed best to unfasten the horses and lead them still
deeper into the wood, so as to make certain of their being out
of sight of any Indians who might appear in the path or
clearing. Then they were fastened to the limbs of trees, so
as to prevent their straying, and then, under the leadership of
the Texan, they pushed on for the retreat to which reference
has been made.</p>

<p>A half-mile or thereabouts brought them the creek beside
which the path led for some distance, and then a few hundred
yards to the right and the refuge was reached.</p>

<p>Crockett saw an irregular pile of rocks, jutting out over
the creek, but no sort of entrance was visible.</p>

<p>Katrina, however, sprung nimbly upon the first bowlder
and walked rapidly up and over the mass, followed by the
others, until she had gone about twenty feet, when she leaped
down a distance about equal to her own hight, and their destination
was reached.</p>

<p>It did not prove to be much of a cavern, but the rocks jutted
and lapped over each other in such a way as to make a
hollow extending about a half-dozen feet back.</p>

<p>The advantages of this retreat were, first, that it was not
likely to be visited by the Comanches, and in case it was, the
occupants were capable of making a successful defense for
some time. They could not be injured by fire, and the
means of approach prevented any mass swarming into and
overwhelming them.</p>

<p>Hunger and thirst were the only effectual agents that could
be brought against them, and, under the circumstances, there
was not much probability of these being employed.</p>

<p>Accordingly, so far as they were concerned themselves, the
three felt warranted in considering themselves perfectly safe.</p>

<p>Then it remained for them to await the withdrawal of the
Comanches, which it was possible would occur within twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>As the Texan had remarked, these Indians strike quick, sharp
blows, and then vanish in time to avoid the recoil. They
own the swiftest mustangs of the south, and are among the
finest horsemen in the world.</p>

<p>Their bravery is unquestioned, and the hunters of Texas,
at any time, would rather fight a score of Mexicans than a
half-dozen of these Comanches.</p>

<p>The whites had scarcely reached their retreat, when they
heard the sounds of guns in the direction of the village, proving
that fighting was going on there.</p>

<p>The sound of guns was incessant, and now and then the
well-known Comanche yells could be distinguished, proving
that serious fighting was going on between them and the
settlers, who ought to be safe, however, on their own ground.</p>

<p>It was only an illustration of the reckless bravery of these
red-men, who were not afraid to be the attacking party, when
the odds were against them.</p>

<p>The rattling fire lasted for full an hour, and then the shots
became dropping and scattering and the fighting evidently assumed
a more desultory character.</p>

<p>As the three whites stood leaning against the wall of rocks
behind them, and looking across the moonlit creek into the
gloomy woods beyond, they became aware of a gradual lighting
up of the sky overhead, with a glare which they soon
saw reflected upon the leaves before them.</p>

<p>"Another fire!" exclaimed Sebastian, in an undertone.</p>

<p>"Close by, too," added Crockett.</p>

<p>"What can it be?" asked Katrina.</p>

<p>"It is the building which we saw, and where we were certain
there was no danger at all from the Indians," replied the
Texan.</p>

<p>"Indeed, our escape has been wonderful," added the astonished
girl; "we have been walking and wandering about in
the woods, with the Indians on every side of us, and yet not
a hair of our heads has been harmed."</p>

<p>"We have been wonderfully protected," responded her
lover, "and I only hope the same care will be continued to
us."</p>

<p>"But others have not been so fortunate."</p>

<p>"No," said Sebastian, with a sigh, "such a raid as this
must always accomplish something. Where there are so
many exposed, some of them must fall. More than one
house will be rendered desolate by this incursion of the Comanches."</p>

<p>It was on the tongue of Katrina, as the thought of her uncle
entered her mind, to say that one home had already been
made so; but she recalled the promise made to her lover and
held her peace.</p>

<p>By this time the night was more than half gone, and the
three began to look for the appearance of day.</p>

<p>The opinion of the Texan was that there would be a good
deal of fighting on the morrow, as the Comanches would be
likely to scatter in small bands through the country, seeking
out the exposed settlers, and wreaking their revenge upon
them, for the repulse they were sure to receive at the hands
of the villagers.</p>

<p>This day would prove the dangerous one for the fugitives
hiding beside the creek.</p>

<p>Through all the hurry and bustle of danger, Crockett had
held fast to the bear-skin, which he had stripped from the
body of the monster with whom he had such a hard combat
upon entering the cabin of Hans Bungslager.</p>

<p>He now spread this upon the rock, as far back as they
could penetrate, and invited Katrina to lie down and rest.</p>

<p>Her lover urged her to do the same, but she waited until
his blanket was laid upon it, and then she reclined, and
owing to her great fatigue almost immediately dropped asleep.</p>

<p>The two men advanced to the outer edge of rocks and sat
down to consult a few moments upon the situation, and to
speak without restraint regarding the disappearance of Hans
Bungslager.</p>

<p>"I feel some hope regarding him," said the Texan, "but I
can not call up any <i>reason</i> for such a hope."</p>

<p>"I believe he's gone under <i>sure</i>," replied Crockett; "they've
managed to git him away from us and then knifed him so
quick that he hadn't any time to make any noise about it."</p>

<p>"Poor Katrina! it will be a hard blow for her, for she
dearly loved her uncle, who as dearly loved her."</p>

<p>"It didn't look much like it, when he come away and forgot
her."</p>

<p>"He told the truth when he said he forgot her; he is the
most absent-minded man I ever saw. He sometimes forgets
where he is, and until I asked him where she was, he had no
idea that he had such a thing in the broad world as a niece
named Katrina Duncan."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has wandered away in one of his absent
spells."</p>

<p>"It may be, but I hardly believe it."</p>

<p>All this time, while the two were talking, each had been
listening to something on the opposite side of the stream.</p>

<p>Neither had made any reference to it, as he wanted to
avoid any mistake, but while holding converse, their eyes
kept wandering across the stream in quest of the cause of
the disturbance.</p>

<p>The disturbance itself was in the shape of a slight rustling
of the bushes. At first, it seemed to be caused by the wind;
but when it was continued and repeated for several minutes, it
was manifest that there was some definite cause for it.</p>

<p>More than one glance had been cast across the creek, but
nothing at all was discerned for some time, that could explain
what it meant.</p>

<p>Instinctively reading the thoughts of Crockett, the Texan
said:</p>

<p>"I guess it's a wild animal."</p>

<p>"I think so; very likely a bear," was the characteristic reply.</p>

<p>"'Sh! look!"</p>

<p>At that juncture the dark form of the creature was discerned
in the bushes on the other side of the creek.</p>

<p>Crockett caught up his rifle, but the Texan interposed.</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute; do you think that is a bear?"</p>

<p>"I'm sartin of it."</p>

<p>"It looks like a bear," replied young Carsfield, the Texan,
"but, <i>my opinion is that it is a Comanche warrior</i>!"</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span>HANS BUNGSLAGER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>I have spoken of the feeling, or rather conviction, that
came over Hans Bungslager that some one or some thing was
following him. This conviction became more settled, and
when he dismounted on the edge of the clearing not a particle
of doubt remained.</p>

<p>He walked forward where Katrina and Crockett were standing,
and referred to the annoyance, and then something else
coming into his head, he forgot all about it.</p>

<p>Walking back where his horse was standing, he was about
to elevate himself to his seat, when he heard a pattering upon
the leaves, and looking down the path, saw what appeared to
be a huge bear cavorting about fifty rods distant.</p>

<p>"Doonder and blitzen! I dinks dat vos you!" he muttered,
the instant he saw the creature, "and I gets you now!"</p>

<p>Rifle in hand, he started on a heavy run, determined to give
the audacious brute his <i>quietus</i> for his attempts to disturb him.</p>

<p>The bear seemed to take fright at his coming, and danced
further away. Several times the Hollander raised his gun,
but ere he could make his aim sure, the creature managed to
get a tree between him and his foe, who lowered his piece,
and, with an exclamation of impatience, hurried forward to
get a better position.</p>

<p>This game at bo-peep continued for a long time, and Hans
Bungslager was drawn much further away from his friends
than he supposed. He was determined to shoot the intruder
when he started, and the oftener he was baffled the more determined
did he become.</p>

<p>Once he had the aim exactly, and pulled the trigger with
such vigor that he came nigh breaking it, but found he had
not raised the hammer, and when he lowered his piece to
rectify the error, and raised it again, the aim was lost.</p>

<p>"Dat ish bad as never vas!" growled the angered Dutchman,
as he panted forward again, rapidly gaining on the creature.</p>

<p>By and by he was sure of a chance; he saw the bear sitting
on his haunches near the path, and resting his rifle on the
crotch of a dead limb, he took deliberate aim at the body of
the brute.</p>

<p>His dumpy finger was pressing the trigger again, when he
discovered that he was aiming at a stump, and the bear was
tumbling along a hundred feet in advance.</p>

<p>"Doonderation!" gasped Hans Bungslager, almost dropping
his gun in amazement, "dat bear must have shpit dat stump
up ag'in."</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, however, he resumed his pursuit, and was
gaining quite rapidly on the creature, when he saw something
that alarmed him.</p>

<p>In hurrying along the path it was frequently only barely
discernible, and then when reaching a place where the moonlight
streamed down upon it, it could be distinguished with
great distinctness.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions Hans saw the bear run on its
hind feet in a style such as no bear in the world could be
trained to do, and in just such a posture as a man would take
who was tired of running in a stooping position on his hands
and knees.</p>

<p>The conclusion was inevitable; he was chasing an Indian
disguised as a black bear.</p>

<p>"Doonder and blitzen!" muttered Bungslager, as a cold chill
of terror ran through him at the discovery, "dat ish&mdash;dat ish&mdash;<i>fooney</i>!"</p>

<p>Obtuse and reckless as he was at times, the Hollander had
brains enough to perceive the deadly peril into which he had
run. The Comanche had adopted this artifice to draw him
away from his friends, and to encompass his destruction.</p>

<p>He was in a quandary as to what he should do.</p>

<p>If he kept on his pursuit, one result was inevitable, and if
he turned to retreat, following the path back again, the cunning
red-skin would know that his stratagem had been detected,
and he in turn would become pursuer and assailant.</p>

<p>Hans was never a good shot with a rifle, and he was pretty
certain that this bear was protected in some such a way that
he could not be injured by any rifle however well aimed, so
he gave over all thought of injuring the savage by means of
his gun.</p>

<p>He could see only one thing that offered any hope, and that
was to give the Indian the slip. He was now quite a distance
ahead, and still seeking to allure him on. They were entering
a part of the wood that looked quite dense and dark, and here
Hans resolved to make the effort to get out of an exceedingly
bad scrape.</p>

<p>So he followed along, trotting in his elephantine style, and
to carry out the illusion, he called out:</p>

<p>"Hold on, you pig coward bears; I got you now, and I
shoots you sure, in one minnit."</p>

<p>The bear, somewhat alarmed, trotted so rapidly ahead that
it was nearly lost to view in the darkness.</p>

<p>Now was his time.</p>

<p>Dropping as suddenly as if he was shot, he crawled on all
fours, as rapidly as his bulky form would admit, until he had
gone something like a hundred feet, when, panting and tired,
he paused and listened.</p>

<p>The darkness around him was too great for him to see
any thing of the "bear," but the sound of a faint, muffled
whoop told him that he had been none too soon in his movement,
and his foe was signaling to some confederate, and
they were both endeavoring to remedy the slip upon their part.</p>

<p>"Yaw; lets 'em look!" chuckled Hans. "I dinks dey
won't find me purty soon as never vos."</p>

<p>Waiting until he was thoroughly rested and could hear no
more, he arose to his feet, and resumed his flight, taking good
care to continue on in the direction upon which he had
started, and going further and further away from the dangerous
vicinity of his enemy, who had shown so much ingenuity
in endeavoring to draw him on to his own destruction.</p>

<p>So far as he could do so, Hans Bungslager advanced without
making any noise, for he knew how sharp the sense of
hearing was upon the part of the Indians. He plodded along
in this manner, for the better part of an hour, when his further
progress was checked by his coming upon the bank of
the creek, to which I have made frequent reference.</p>

<p>Here he paused in a quandary.</p>

<p>"I dink I kin wades across dat," he mused, as he surveyed
the calmly flowing stream, "and den I gits on de oder side,
and den I dinks I ought to be on dis side, so I won't stay
here nor goes to de oder side."</p>

<p>This perhaps was a sage conclusion, but rather difficult of
fulfillment. Very naturally he felt safer upon the other bank
of the creek, further away from the plotting Indians: but he
was well aware that the stream was quite deep in some
places.</p>

<p>He stood undecided some minutes, and then the point was
settled by hearing the report of a gun at no great distance
behind him.</p>

<p>"Doonder!" he exclaimed with a start, "mebbe dey shoots
dat at me! I dink I leaf!"</p>

<p>Anxious as he was to advance, and warm as was the summer
night, he preferred to reach the other shore in dry clothes;
so he sat down upon the bank and carefully removed his
shoes and pants, and tying them into a bundle, slung them
over the barrel of his rifle, which rested over his shoulder,
and then ventured into the stream.</p>

<p>"Dish ish nice," he murmured, as the cool water crept
up about his bulky calves, "dish ain't deep."</p>

<p>Step by step he felt his way along, until he had reached
the center of the stream, where the water was not more
than eighteen inches.</p>

<p>"Dish ish bettrish goot," he continued, "dish ish de way
to cross de brooks. I dinks dat I alway does&mdash;"</p>

<p>Despite his care, at this juncture he went into a hole, up
to his neck. As he sunk down, he gasped:</p>

<p>"Oo&mdash;oo!"</p>

<p>At the same time, he threw up both arms with such an involuntary
suddenness that the bundle dropped from his gun
and began floating away from him.</p>

<p>"Doonder and blitzen!" he exclaimed, as he plunged after
it, still grasping his gun, with a vice-like grip.</p>

<p>He managed to secure the bundle just as it was sinking,
but it was only a partial success. The indispensables remained
in his hands, but the shoes, with the carefully knit
stockings wadded in them, vanished from his view.</p>

<p>He groped around in the water some time for them, but
they were not to be found, and not a little disappointed, he
made his way to land, narrowly escaping a total submerge
ere he succeeded.</p>

<p>He concluded that this way of crossing was not without
its disadvantages, and he was not clear in his mind that he
could recommend its adoption to his friends.</p>

<p>But, Hans was a sort of philosopher, and donning his pants,
put himself in the best condition possible.</p>

<p>At this juncture it occurred to him that perhaps Katrina
would be somewhat concerned at his absence, and he regretted
that he had not made known his intention before he started
in pursuit of his bear.</p>

<p>He debated the matter awhile, but saw no practical way of
remedying the matter, and resolved to give it no further attention.</p>

<p>Child-like, he still felt the desire to keep moving, under the
impression that he was getting further and further away from
his peril.</p>

<p>He had not accomplished any considerable distance, when
he found that he was unequal to the task of what would have
been but sport in his boyhood. He was not walking upon
a carpet, nor anything like it. In the darkness he could not
pick his way, and the part of prudence was for him to stop.</p>

<p>"I dinks I takes a nap, and shtarts when de morning comes
to-morrow," he murmured, as he selected a suitable spot and
stretched himself upon the ground, where, for the present, I
leave him sleeping the sleep of innocence and health.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span>THE COMANCHE BEAR.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The declaration of Sebastian Carsfield that the object seen
by him and Crockett across the creek, instead of being a bear,
was an Indian gotten up in that shape, let in a flood of light
upon both.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't shoot!" added the Texan; "let us go back,
where he can't hit us, and we will watch it."</p>

<p>They carefully withdrew a few paces, and lying down flat
upon the rock, peered over at the suspicious object.</p>

<p>They discovered little or nothing more. The dark huge
figure of the animal was seen for a few minutes, groping
around in the undergrowth, when it took itself off and did
not come back.</p>

<p>"That's the bear I see'd on the clearin'," remarked Crockett;
"and that Katrina wouldn't let me shoot."</p>

<p>"Yes; it would have been a good thing if you could have
put a ball through it. I think it has been by some such
means that Hans Bungslager has been led on into the woods
to his own destruction."</p>

<p>The night was so clear and still that the two men, almost
unconsciously, fell asleep, as they lay stretched out upon the
rock.</p>

<p>The hours passed on, and when it began to grow light, Katrina
awoke and advanced to the front of the cavern, and
paused beside the two men stretched out there.</p>

<p>Both were sleeping soundly, and she looked at them for a
few minutes with feelings of commiseration.</p>

<p>"They are tired out and wearied," she murmured; "they
will need sleep, and I will let them be until I return."</p>

<p>Very carefully she came down from among the rocks, and
advancing to the edge of the creek bathed herself in it. The
water was so cool and refreshing that she plashed her hands
it for several minutes.</p>

<p>No thought of danger entered her head, as she believed the
place so secluded that there was scarcely a possibility of their
being disturbed by the foes they dreaded so much. Had she
known what her friends had seen during the previous night,
she would have been more careful in her movements.</p>

<p>She was about a hundred yards from where the men were
sleeping, and sat down on the mossy bank of the stream for
a few minutes to enjoy a slight breeze that was fanning her
face and that made music among the rustling leaves.</p>

<p>The sky was clear, and the sunlight penetrated the woods
with its revivifying influence; but for the disappearance of
her uncle she would have been in the best of spirits. The
cabin had been swept away, but she and the two men had escaped
with their lives, and to her, it seemed that scarcely any
danger had passed.</p>

<p>She had sat thus some ten minutes or thereabouts, when a
crackling of the bushes across the stream caused her to raise
her head, and she caught sight of what appeared to be a large
black bear.</p>

<p>It was only a partial glimpse that she obtained, and the
animal seemed to be going away from her further into the
wood.</p>

<p>"I guess he hasn't seen me," she concluded, as something
warned her that she had already remained away from the
cavern too long.</p>

<p>So she concluded to wait a few minutes longer, as she felt
a reluctance to awake the hunters, who so badly needed sleep.</p>

<p>A short time after, she heard a ripple in the water above
her, and she looked up-stream, but saw nothing.</p>

<p>For the reason she was a moment too late. Had she been
a little more prompt, she would have detected that same "Comanche
bear," carefully wading across the creek, and using
his hind legs in such a manner that he stood upright like a
man.</p>

<p>Katrina was unusually short-sighted to-day. Even when
the water in front of her flowed by dark and discolored, she
failed to take warning, and sat some time longer in a sort of
dreamy reverie, hardly conscious of what was going on about
her.</p>

<p>But after awhile she roused herself to her situation and
with a sigh rose to her feet, and started on her return.</p>

<p>Her senses were now on the alert, and so, when she had
taken a dozen steps or so, she caught a glimpse of the bear,
she had seen some time before, and it was now directly between
her and the rocks she was seeking to reach.</p>

<p>This was bad, as she still had no gun in hand, and could
not therefore defend herself if attacked.</p>

<p>The manner of the brute seemed to indicate that he was
not aware of her proximity, and she leaped lightly behind a
tree, for the purpose of concealing herself.</p>

<p>She stood thus some ten minutes, debating whether she
should call to Carsfield or Crockett, or wait until they should
awake themselves, or the bear should withdraw.</p>

<p>It looked as if the latter were about to be the case, as the
bear seemed to be browsing around in an aimless way, constantly
on the move, and therefore he would be likely soon to
move far enough to one side to permit her to reach her refuge.</p>

<p>For this she waited, now and then growing impatient at
the tardy movements of the bear. The latter was constantly
stirring about, but somehow or other, it appeared to be back
and forth, between her and the rocks, and never once so
much to one side, as to tempt her to make the effort.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Katrina could not shut her eyes to the fact,
that the brute was gradually approaching her.</p>

<p>This, in the course of a few minutes became so apparent, that
the girl felt that her situation was becoming critical. A terror
of alarm shook her frame, and she was on the point of uttering
a call to her lover, when the bear shied off to one side
so much as to give her the "opening," so ardently desired.</p>

<p>Katrina stood trembling and hesitating for a moment, and
then with one ejaculated prayer, started like a fawn for the
rocks.</p>

<p>She did not look to the right nor left, but she had scarcely
started, when she became aware that the bear had risen
on his hind feet and was seeking to intercept her.</p>

<p>Faster she ran, until she seemed to fly over the ground,
but the bear was more fleet of foot than she, and scarcely a
dozen steps had elapsed, when it became certain that she was
to be intercepted by her enemy.</p>

<p>Then Katrina turned her affrighted gaze upon her foe, and
instead of a bear saw a Comanche warrior, with a bear-skin
thrown over his shoulder, and its frightful head upon top of
his own, directly in front of her.</p>

<p>Still she sought to escape him; but the next instant his
brawny arm was thrown around her, and as he turned to flee
with his captive, her terrified scream rung through the woods
and she swooned away.</p>

<span>COLONEL CROCKETT'S LAST BEAR-HUNT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>"Surely I heard some one call me," muttered Sebastian
Carsfield, the Texan, as he roused himself up and rubbed his
eyes. "What does this mean? Crockett and I have both
been asleep. What a warning to a sentinel not to lie down or
give way to drowsiness. But was that voice a dream or a
reality&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned his head and saw that Katrina was gone.</p>

<p>With a dreadful, chilling horror at his breast, he sprung to
his feet, looked around and called out, "<i>Katrina!</i> <span class="smcap">Katrina!</span>
KATRINA!"</p>

<p>That voice penetrated far through the woods and reached
the ears of her who was being carried so swiftly away in the
grasp of the painted Comanche. She sought to reply, but
the brute checked her utterance, and the shrieks died out into
a gasping sob.</p>

<p>"What's up now?" demanded Crockett, awakened by the
tumult of his comrade.</p>

<p>"God knows what's become of Katrina," was the despairing
reply; "she has vanished, gone or been stolen."</p>

<p>"Maybe she's somewhere about," replied the Tennesseean,
rousing himself.</p>

<p>"No; I am sure it was her calling to me that awoke me a
few minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Then we oughter be on the move," added Crockett, leaping
to his feet. "What direction did it come from?"</p>

<p>"Coming to me in my sleep, I can hardly tell; but it strikes
me that it was from off yonder."</p>

<p>Crockett, led by some indefinable impulse, snatched up the
bear-skin, and with it over his arm, sprung down from among
the rocks into the woods below.</p>

<p>"We must take the trail," he added to the Texan, who
had already discovered it on the ground, and answered:</p>

<p>"There it is, leading toward the creek. She has gone
there to bathe herself."</p>

<p>A few moments sufficed to take them to the spot, where
she had spent a half-hour or so, early in the morning, and
then they observed the circuitous route back again, which
suggested that she had discovered or was seeking to avoid
some danger.</p>

<p>There was no difficulty in tracing the footsteps to the point
where the Comanche bear had seized and borne her away.
The prints on the ground perplexed them for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"They were made by an Indian without a doubt," said the
Texan.</p>

<p>"And that Indian," said Crockett, "was the bear that we
saw last night on t'other side of the creek."</p>

<p>"That's it! that's it!" fairly gasped young Carsfield; "it's
their old tricks over again. He can't be far away anyhow,
and we will run him into the ground before he can reach his
confederates."</p>

<p>The Tennesseean was satisfied that this was the true course,
and the two started forward at once, the trail over the dead
and rumpled leaves being such that it was easily followed.</p>

<p>"He is running very fast," added Sebastian, when they had
progressed something like a hundred yards upon their way.</p>

<p>"But he can't carry the gal and outrun us besides."</p>

<p>"He'll make her do her own running after awhile."</p>

<p>"Is she good on the jump?" inquired Crockett.</p>

<p>"She runs very swiftly," said the lover, "and you may be
sure that dog will make her do her best."</p>

<p>"It strikes me that them varmints are tryin' to take prisoners,
instead of raisin' the ha'r of the settlers through these
parts."</p>

<p>"That's it," was the reply, uttered on the run.</p>

<p>Such indeed seemed to be the case, when the past actions
of the Comanches were considered, for, it can be seen that
more than once they had it in their power to pick off the
whites by deathly shot from the wood, but had refrained, and
resorted to strategy to secure them.</p>

<p>Hans Bungslager had been "operated" upon in this way, and
had only escaped through a providential gleam of prudence
that flashed through his brain at the right moment.</p>

<p>The trail followed by the Texan and Tennesseean, for a
long distance, went straight forward into the woods, as though
aiming at no particular point, but seeking to get as far away
from pursuit as was possible.</p>

<p>They were still following hard after the abductor, when
they crossed the path leading to Brownston, and over which
they had passed a few hours before.</p>

<p>They paused an instant, looking to the right and left, but
nothing was to be seen, and the trail of the flying Indian was
seen to cross the path at right-angles.</p>

<p>"That is encouraging," exclaimed Sebastian.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked his companion.</p>

<p>"It looks as if he were going it alone, instead of hunting
up his companions."</p>

<p>"Don't be sartin of that. He ain't an Injin, if he don't
know what place his nose is p'intin' at, and he'll find some
other scamps afore long to help him."</p>

<p>Crockett proved right in this instance, for they had gone
but a short distance further, when they came in sight of the
camp-fire. Their skill in trail-hunting was not sufficient for
them to make certain of the time that had elapsed since the
passing of the Comanche and his prize; but they knew they
could not be very far behind the scamp, and they kept their
eyes on the look-out that they did not run blindly into any
danger.</p>

<p>So they detected the faint curling smoke on the bank of
a small stream in time to prevent exposing themselves, and
they made a careful reconnoissance.</p>

<p>Four Comanche Indians were seated around a small fire,
every one smoking. The smell of cooking food was in the
air, showing that they had finished a good breakfast. Around
them were scattered the contents of several feather-beds,
linen, calico and clothing, attesting very plainly that they
had "gone through" somebody's establishment in a most
effective manner.</p>

<p>Upon a heap of blankets sat Katrina Duncan, her face
covered and her head bent in despair. The Indians were
eagerly discussing some matter, and paid no attention to their
helpless captive.</p>

<p>The Texan and Tennesseean withdrew a few paces to consult
as to what they should do. As there were five of their
foes, it was hardly practicable to make an attack upon them.
From their concealment, the whites could pick off two. The
course of the other three in all probability then would be to
kill Katrina as quick as a flash, so as to prevent the possibility
of her rescue, and then to turn and attack the two whites,
with a very good prospect of finishing them off in the same
manner; for no living Indians can out-dodge, out-shoot or
out-wit, or out-fight these same Comanches of the South-west.
With an odd man, they would be certain to get into the rear
of the whites, and when that was done, it would be a long
and last good-by to them.</p>

<p>"I don't see the bear," remarked Carsfield; "he may have
thrown off the skin, but I was unable to see it upon the
ground."</p>

<p>"He's gone back, thinkin' we're at the rocks, to try and
fool us."</p>

<p>Carsfield was strongly inclined to believe this.</p>

<p>"Where is Bungslager?"</p>

<p>"That is hard to tell," said Crockett; "we can think only
of <i>her</i> at present."</p>

<p>The Texan turned suddenly upon his companion.</p>

<p>"See here, you have a bear-skin with you; isn't it possible
for you to play the bear too?"</p>

<p>Colonel Crockett took at once.</p>

<p>"I'll do it."</p>

<p>And straightway he began arraying himself in the costume
of the animal. He succeeded in making quite a resemblance,
but when it was finished both saw that the thing could
not be done during daylight.</p>

<p>The only way by which they could hope to succeed was
by Crockett actually <i>taking the place of</i> the Comanche who
had been playing the part of bear. Any critical scrutiny of
the counterfeit by the Indians would be certain to result in
their detection of the trick. If they could be made to believe
that Crockett was their own comrade frolicking about
the camp, they would not be apt to bestow much attention
upon him. Still, as it was certain that the trick would be
discovered sooner or later, it was all-important that they
should have the darkness of night in which to work.</p>

<p>Accordingly the two withdrew to a safe distance, and the
Texan went on a little foraging expedition of his own, managing
to secure enough food for present purposes.</p>

<p>One or two of the Comanches was constantly going and
coming, and they kept the Indians under surveillance. Katrina
was furnished with food, but the camp was not broken and
it was evident they intended to spend the night where they
were.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon the "Comanche Bear" walked into
camp, carrying his hide thrown over his shoulder. He remained
for an hour or two and then departed, and, as it was
now fully dark, Crockett prepared to venture upon his dangerous
experiment.</p>

<p>Young Carsfield approached as near the camp as prudent,
and then Crockett went sidling and galloping toward it,
approaching gradually, and yet concealing his identity as
much as possible.</p>

<p>When he came within the circle of light, all five of the
Indians looked at him, and then paid no further heed, evidently
believing it to be their comrade, practicing to improve
himself.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer he approached the spot where Katrina
was sitting, she looking at him with a look of terror, as if
uncertain whether he was watching her or not. This was
what Crockett wished, and he managed, unseen by the Indians,
to give her a sign which put her on her guard.</p>

<p>One of the Comanches looked suspiciously at him, but he
advanced until he was within a few feet of Katrina, when he
called out to her in a husky whisper:</p>

<p>"<i>Now run, right by me!</i>"</p>

<p>Having no thought of any such thing, her captors had not
bound her, and the girl darted off like a deer, leaping directly
by Crockett, who immediately followed hard after her.</p>

<p>It looked as if she had started in affright at the approach of
the bear, and all ought to have gone well, had not the genuine
Comanche bear, at this critical moment, put in an appearance.</p>

<p>This exposed the whole thing, and in an instant the Indians
were on their feet, in full pursuit, with their tricky companion
at their head.</p>

<p>But Katrina had gained a good start, and had scarcely entered
the real gloom of the wood when her lover was beside
her, holding her hand, and they fled with all the speed at
their command.</p>

<p>A few sharp turns, and they got beyond all danger; but
the Comanche who had played the part of bruin, followed so
hard after Crockett that he could not elude him.</p>

<p>"<i>Wal, if I must, I must!</i>" muttered the Tennesseean, drawing
his fearful Bowie and turning upon the red-skin.</p>

<p>The contest was over in a second almost. As the Indian
sunk before the fearful knife, Crockett was just in time to
turn and elude the others, who were coming up with much
rapidity.</p>

<p>He had a hard time of it, and but for the shelter of the
wood, would not have succeeded in getting away; but he
soon ceased from his great exertions, and after an hour's cautious
signaling managed to rejoin the lovers, remarking, as he
related his experience:</p>

<p>"Somehow or other I sorter feel this is the last b'ar-hunt
I'll ever take a hand in!"</p>

<p>They endeavored to laugh at his depression, and he purposely
changed the conversation, as he wished to cast no gloom
over their happiness.</p>

<p>It was now deemed best to approach as near Brownston as
possible, so as to be ready to enter the village, if it could be
done, early in the morning.</p>

<p>They accordingly resumed their cautious way through the
woods, but had not gone far when they heard approaching
footsteps.</p>

<p>The whites instantly halted, and the two men grasped their
rifles, ready for friend or foe.</p>

<p>"Doonder and blitzen! I's been valkin' ever sin' to-morrow
mornin', and I ain't so fur off te village as I would be yesterday
ef I had started next week!"</p>

<p>It was Hans, and the next minute all three were around
him, grasping his hands, Katrina weeping and embracing him,
and all demanding what it meant.</p>

<p>He explained, in his characteristic way, what had happened
to him since his separation, and adding that he was nearly
famished with hunger; but as there was no means of relieving
him, the journey was continued until they were in sight
of the gleaming lights of the settlement.</p>

<p>As a careful reconnoissance failed to discover any thing
of the Comanches, they moved on and entered Brownston,
where they learned that the marauding Indians had taken their
departure during the afternoon, and the memorable raid was
ended.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A few days later, Crockett and his friends, who were awaiting
his return in the village, started for the Alamo, where,
as it is well known, this extraordinary man was inhumanly
killed, with the remnant of the garrison who had surrendered
to the perfidious Santa Anna.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The little cottage at Brownston became the home of Katrina
Duncan when she married the gallant Sebastian Carsfield, after
the independence of Texas was acknowledged by Mexico.</p>

<p>Hans Bungslager had a comfortable little sum stowed away
where no Comanches could lay their hands upon it, and with
this he rebuilt his cabin, bought a new cow, and he and his
frow spent many days together upon the same ground that
had been the witness of so many fearful scenes in their history.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
